<p class="noindent">The character and credit of the British Army must chiefly
depend upon the zeal and ardour, by which all who enter
into its service are animated, and consequently it is of the
highest importance that any measure calculated to excite the
spirit of emulation, by which alone great and gallant actions
are achieved, should be adopted.</p>

<p>Nothing can more fully tend to the accomplishment of this
desirable object, than a full display of the noble deeds with
which the Military History of our country abounds. To hold
forth these bright examples to the imitation of the youthful
soldier, and thus to incite him to emulate the meritorious
conduct of those who have preceded him in their honourable
career, are among the motives that have given rise to the
present publication.</p>

<p>The operations of the British Troops are, indeed, announced
in the 'London Gazette,' from whence they are transferred
into the public prints: the achievements of our armies are thus
made known at the time of their occurrence, and receive the
tribute of praise and admiration to which they are entitled.
On extraordinary occasions, the Houses of Parliament have
been in the habit of conferring on the Commanders, and the
Officers and Troops acting under their orders, expressions of
approbation and of thanks for their skill and bravery, and these
testimonials, confirmed by the high honour of their Sovereign's
Approbation, constitute the reward which the soldier most
highly prizes.</p>

<p>It has not, however, until late years, been the practice (which
appears to have long prevailed in some of the Continental
armies) for British Regiments to keep regular records of their
services and achievements. Hence some difficulty has been
experienced in obtaining, particularly from the old Regiments,
an authentic account of their origin and subsequent services.</p>

<p>This defect will now be remedied, in consequence of His
Majesty having been pleased to command, that every Regiment
shall in future keep a full and ample record of its services at
home and abroad.</p>

<p>From the materials thus collected, the country will henceforth
derive information as to the difficulties and privations
which chequer the career of those who embrace the military
profession. In Great Britain, where so large a number of
persons are devoted to the active concerns of agriculture,
manufactures, and commerce, and where these pursuits have,
for so long a period, been undisturbed by the <em>presence of war</em>,
which few other countries have escaped, comparatively little
is known of the vicissitudes of active service, and of the
casualties of climate, to which, even during peace, the British
Troops are exposed in every part of the globe, with little or
no interval of repose.</p>

<p>In their tranquil enjoyment of the blessings which the
country derives from the industry and the enterprise of the agriculturist
and the trader, its happy inhabitants may be supposed
not often to reflect on the perilous duties of the soldier and
the sailor,&mdash;on their sufferings,&mdash;and on the sacrifice of valuable
life, by which so many national benefits are obtained
and preserved.</p>

<p>The conduct of the British Troops, their valour, and endurance,
have shone conspicuously under great and trying difficulties;
and their character has been established in Continental
warfare by the irresistible spirit with which they have effected
debarkations in spite of the most formidable opposition, and
by the gallantry and steadiness with which they have maintained
their advantages against superior numbers.</p>

<p>In the official Reports made by the respective Commanders,
ample justice has generally been done to the gallant exertions
of the Corps employed; but the details of their services, and
of acts of individual bravery, can only be fully given in the
Annals of the various Regiments.</p>

<p>These Records are now preparing for publication, under
His Majesty's special authority, by Mr. <span class="smcap">Richard Cannon</span>,
Principal Clerk of the Adjutant-General's Office; and while
the perusal of them cannot fail to be useful and interesting to
military men of every rank, it is considered that they will also
afford entertainment and information to the general reader,
particularly to those who may have served in the Army, or
who have relatives in the Service.</p>

<p>There exists in the breasts of most of those who have served,
or are serving, in the Army, an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Esprit du Corps</i>&mdash;an attachment
to every thing belonging to their Regiment; to such
persons a narrative of the services of their own Corps cannot
fail to prove interesting. Authentic accounts of the actions
of the great,&mdash;the valiant,&mdash;the loyal, have always been of
paramount interest with a brave and civilized people. Great
Britain has produced a race of heroes who, in moments of
danger and terror, have stood, "firm as the rocks of their
native shore;" and when half the World has been arrayed
against them, they have fought the battles of their Country
with unshaken fortitude. It is presumed that a record of
achievements in war,&mdash;victories so complete and surprising,
gained by our countrymen,&mdash;our brothers&mdash;our fellow-citizens
in arms,&mdash;a record which revives the memory of the brave,
and brings their gallant deeds before us, will certainly prove
acceptable to the public.</p>

<p>Biographical memoirs of the Colonels and other distinguished
Officers, will be introduced in the Records of their respective
Regiments, and the Honorary Distinctions which have, from
time to time, been conferred upon each Regiment, as testifying
the value and importance of its services, will be faithfully
set forth.</p>

<p>As a convenient mode of Publication, the Record of each
Regiment will be printed in a distinct number, so that when
the whole shall be completed, the Parts may be bound up in
numerical succession.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1661</div>

<p class="noindent">The Second Regiment of Foot was raised in 1661, for
the purpose of providing a garrison for <em>Tangier</em>, a fortress
on the northern coast of Africa, which was ceded to
England as part of the marriage portion of Donna
Catherina, Infanta of Portugal, who, in the following
year, was married to King Charles II<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>The command of this regiment was conferred by King
Charles II. on Henry (second) Earl of Peterborough,
whose commission as Colonel bears date the 30th of September,
1661.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>
<p>King Charles II. having, soon after his restoration,
disbanded the army of the Commonwealth, the ranks
of Lord Peterborough's regiment were speedily completed
with disciplined soldiers: it is reported to have assembled
on Putney heath on the 14th of October, 1661,
and to have numbered one thousand men.</p>

<p>The destination of Lord Peterborough's regiment to
garrison so valuable a portion of Her Majesty's dower
was, no doubt, the cause of its early advancement to
royal favour: it was designated 'the <em>Queen's</em>,' and the
<em>Paschal Lamb</em>, the distinguishing badge of Portugal,
was placed on its colours, and has ever since been continued
to be borne by the regiment<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1662</div>

<p>In a few months after its formation, the <em>Earl of
Peterborough</em> embarked with his regiment and a troop of
horse<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>, and arrived at <em>Tangier</em> on the 29th of January,
1662, where he found a British fleet, under the command
of the <em>Earl of Sandwich</em>, lying in the roads, and <em>Sir
Richard Steyner</em>, with a detachment of officers and seamen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>occupying the town: a duty from which the <em>Queen's</em>
Regiment, relieved them on the following day<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>.</p>

<p>The fortress was already surrounded by walls upwards
of a mile and a quarter in extent, but the
English began constructing, at immense cost both of
money and labour, a series of external fortifications.
It was also determined to form a secure harbour by
building a pier, or mole, several hundred yards in length.
A spirit of enterprise, which has since become so conspicuous
in British subjects, was, at this early period,
strongly evinced in these improvements, carried on amidst
barbarian tribes on the unpromising shores of Africa.</p>

<p>Tangier was announced after its occupation 'a place
of such concernment that all the world will envy the
English the attainment of it;' but this opinion was
founded more on an expectation that the new colony
would open a mart for trade, and bring to our influence,
if not to our power, the adjoining states. It was, however,
an acquisition of consequence to a nation aiming
at commercial rivalry at a time when the voyage to
India by the Cape of Good Hope was of rare occurrence.
Tangier was situated so as to be a convenient resting-place
for the Mediterranean trader, similar to what
Gibraltar affords at the present time. These speculations
gave the command a great importance, made
evident by the warrant from King Charles II. on the
appointment of the <em>Earl of Peterborough</em> to his government.
It designates him '<em>Captain General, Chief
Governor, and Vice-Admiral of our City of Tangier,
and of the ports and coasts adjacent, and any of our
dominions and territories, castles and forts, in or near
the kingdom of Tangier, Fez, and Morocco, in Africa,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>which are or shall be in our possession, or reduced to
our obedience, &amp;c.</em>'</p>

<p>On the arrival of Lord Peterborough at <em>Tangier</em>, he
found Gaylan, the sovereign chief of Fez, with a body of
10,000 men, encamped within a league of the fortress.
A treaty of peace was concluded between these commanders,
and limits were fixed, beyond which the English
were not to forage or cultivate. No great reliance
was placed by the British on their new ally, and accounts
from the new colony state, 'how the Moors will observe
these articles we know not; however, we are, and we
still shall be, upon our guard.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">1663</div>

<p>Three other battalions of infantry also proceeded to
Tangier from Dunkirk<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>. The friendly understanding
which was established with the natives was for some
time interrupted only by trifling skirmishes, in which
the Moors satisfied themselves by beating back, with
sticks, those of the garrison who passed the stipulated
bounds. A jealousy was, however, very soon evinced;
and upon opposition being made to the English in prosecuting
the works and fortifications already alluded to,
war burst out, in which the number and ferocity of the
Moors were defeated and overcome by great discipline
and courage on the part of the garrison. The use of cannon
by the Europeans at length diminished the courage
of the barbarians, but not before the garrison suffered
severely. They had already lost 250 men, and the Moors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
about 500, amongst whom was a brother of Gaylan,
when a peace was at length concluded in 1663, and Lord
Peterborough returned in the same year to England<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>.</p>

<p><em>The Earl of Peterborough</em> was succeeded, both in the
government of Tangier and in the Colonelcy of the Queen's
Regiment, by Lieutenant-General <span class="smcap">Andrew Rutherford</span>,
<em>Earl of Teviot</em> (late Governor of Dunkirk), whose commission
was dated the 9th of April, 1663. This second
governor of Tangier consolidated all the infantry in
garrison, and added them to the Queen's Tangier Regiment;
he also so beautified and strengthened the town,
that he obtained the title of its 'Restorer.'</p>

<p>Gaylan, hearing of the progress of the works, assembled
an army of 4000 horse and 20,000 foot<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>; and at mid-day,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>on Sunday the 14th of June, 1663, when all the officers
were at dinner, the Moors surprised and carried the
advance-posts and attacked the great redoubt, where
Major Ridgert of the Queen's Regiment, with forty men,
made a most gallant defence, until the garrison, led by
Colonel Norwood, sallied out, and charging the Moors
with signal bravery, retook all the posts which had been
captured. The garrison lost fourteen men killed and
twenty wounded in this encounter; and the enemy upwards
of one hundred. In an account of this action
published at the time, it is stated, 'The Moors are men
of resolution, and have most excellent fire-arms. When
the horse charged us, he that did command them was
clothed in crimson velvet, who being killed, they all
went off immediately; it is presumed, therefore, that
he was one of their chief men.'</p>

<p>A second attack was subsequently made with 10,000
men, 'but the most vigilant governor had so warily
supplied the defects of the place, by planting great
guns to annoy the assailants, that though the assault
was very sharp, the enemy was beaten off with the loss
of 900 men<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>.'</p>

<p>In August a peace was concluded for six months, and
a free trade was opened with the Moors, 'they daily
bringing their camels laden with commodities, and in
return they get money and other things.' Further
additions were also made to the works, which again gave
rise to acts of hostility, and in one encounter the garrison
captured a splendid scarlet standard. A correspondence
was opened with Gaylan&mdash;the Earl of Teviot
insisted on making additional works&mdash;Gaylan objected,
when his Lordship replied, 'he must have peace on
those terms, or war without them.' The latter was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
result, and led to numerous losses, particularly of the
natives, in attempts to assault the fortress.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1664</div>

<p>The chief losses sustained by the garrison of Tangier
were in the sallies they made into the adjacent country
to obtain fresh provisions. The Moors had a custom of
driving two or three hundred head of cattle within sight
of the walls, and planting a body of men in ambuscade,
ready to fall on the detachment, which military ardour,
to say nothing of a natural wish for fresh beef, was sure
to bring beyond the cover of the fortress. These skirmishes
frequently brought on more serious engagements,
and in a sally made by the garrison on the 4th of May,
1664, the <em>Earl of Teviot</em><a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> met his death.</p>

<p>The Earl of Teviot was succeeded in the command of
the Queen's Regiment by Colonel, afterwards Lieutenant-General
<em>Henry Norwood</em>, whose commission is dated
the 10th of June, 1664. The government of Tangier at
this time was bestowed by His Majesty on <em>John Lord
Bellasyse</em>, a younger son of the <em>Earl of Fauconberg</em>,
who arrived at his government in April 1665, on board
the Smyrna fleet, consisting of 'seven lusty, brave ships.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">1665<br />1666</div>

<p><em>Lord Bellasyse</em> found the judicious arrangements of
the late Commander-in-Chief had rendered Tangier impregnable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
to its enemies, who by this time were much
disheartened, and inclined to terminate hostilities. A
peace was concluded in the following year, and Lord
Bellasyse was himself the bearer of it to England, where
he arrived in May, 1666. The London Gazette states
his favourable reception by His Majesty, and great expectations
of future prosperity to Tangier were raised
from his report.</p>

<p><em>General Norwood</em>, who has been mentioned as succeeding,
on the death of the Earl of Teviot, to the command
of the Queen's Regiment, was now appointed to
succeed Lord Bellasyse in his government. His administration
was that of a judicious and vigilant officer;
he acquired the confidence of the Moors, and conciliated
Gaylan the sovereign chief of Fez. General Norwood's
proceedings among the natives were considered so
honourable, and his character, altogether, stood so
high, that the Emperor <em>Muley Xeriff</em> admitted him to
traffic at Tetuan free of imposts; a most beneficial offer,
which he failed not to accept, as it so much concerned
the welfare of Tangier, 'to whose advancement,' says
Addison, 'he always declared a singular propensity.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">1668</div>

<p>The death of this valuable officer, which occurred in
1668, made room for the appointment of <em>John Earl of
Middleton</em>, whose commission, as Governor of Tangier,
and as Colonel of the Queen's Regiment, is dated the
15th of May, 1668.</p>

<p>It was during the colonelcy of the Earl of Middleton,
when war had been resumed with the ferocious Moors,
that this regiment had the honour of numbering amongst
its volunteers the man who afterwards became the most
successful and most celebrated general of his age;&mdash;'the
man who never fought a battle which he did not gain,
or besieged a town which he failed to reduce,&mdash;<span class="smcap">John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Churchill, Duke of Marlborough</span>.' Mr. Churchill
was at this time about twenty years of age, and held an
ensign's commission in the Foot Guards, but made his
first essays, in actual service, beneath the walls of Tangier,
where he eagerly engaged in the frequent sallies
and skirmishes of the garrison, giving, in this desultory
warfare, the first indication of his active and daring
character.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1675</div>

<p>After an administration of nearly seven years, the
Earl of Middleton died in the fortress, on the 25th of
January, 1675<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>. He was succeeded in the command
of <em>Tangier</em>, and also in the colonelcy of the Queen's
Regiment, on the 5th of March, 1675, by <em>William
O'Brien, Earl of Inchiquin</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1678</div>

<p>Tangier had by this time so increased in strength and
importance, that its occupation by the English was
become an object of jealousy, not only to the natives of
the country, but to all European powers. The fortifications
had been rendered secure, and the harbour had
been improved, and now afforded a safe anchorage.
These important points had not been attained without
great opposition from the Moors, and much credit was
given to the garrison for their conduct and steady perseverance
in the arduous duties they had to perform.
We find acknowledgment made of them by the journals
of the day in the following terms:&mdash;'Many and various
have been the warlike exploits of the heroic English
against the barbarians, during the possession of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
famous garrison of Tangier, so much renowned throughout
the world, standing as commandress of those seas,
and a protection to shipping from the Turkish pirates.'
The Oxford Gazette of the same period also contains a
letter from Tangier, reporting a threatened attack from a
French fleet, and adds, 'the soldiers, far from being
surprised at the news, are infinitely rejoiced at it, expecting
them with much impatience.' Thus we find
the Queen's Regiment was ever at its post, and had for
eighteen years, almost single-handed, maintained this
important fortress, in defiance of numerous assaults from
the equally destructive effects of war and climate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1680</div>

<p>Towards the termination of the Earl of Inchiquin's<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
command Tangier became an object of still greater
attention in England. The Emperor of Morocco had
joined with the forces of Fez, and a crusade was carrying
on against the Christian occupants of this part of
Africa; Europeans were found ready to direct the operations
of the savages, and the war assumed an importance
hitherto not bestowed on it. The following is an
account given at the time:&mdash;</p>

<p>'The Moors being vexed, knowing it was impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
to make their approaches against Tangier above ground,
resolved to effect it by drawing lines and working underneath
the earth; which stratagem of war, it is supposed,
they learnt from several French and Spanish mercenaries
whom they keep in pay: this practice they were
before quite ignorant of.'&mdash;The public journals also speak
indignantly of some English who clandestinely imported
1500 barrels of gunpowder to the enemy, and say, ''Tis
too often the custom of our nation to give away their
swords, and fight with their teeth, and furnish our foes
with means to cut our own throats.' Numerous losses
sustained by the garrison, together with the increased
force of the assailants, rendered it requisite to send reinforcements
to the relief of the former. For this purpose
a detachment left Ireland in the spring of 1680, consisting
of four companies of the Royal Regiment of Foot;
twelve other companies of the same regiment followed
in the same year; five companies of the Foot Guards
also sailed for the same destination under the Earl of
Mulgrave.</p>

<p>In addition to the above reinforcements, a new regiment
was raised in 1680, of which <em>Charles Fitz Charles,
Earl of Plymouth</em>, (a natural son of King Charles II.)
was appointed Colonel, and embarked on this service.
This latter corps was called 'the Second Tangier Regiment,'
and is now the 4th, or King's Own Regiment.</p>

<p>It has been stated that the Duke of Marlborough was
initiated at Tangier in the first rudiments of war. The
same theatre for the display of British valour and enterprise
was at this time chosen by several other volunteers,
among whom were Charles Lord Mordaunt, the afterwards
celebrated Earl of Peterborough, and others of rank
and celebrity.</p>

<p>In the year 1680 the Earl of Inchiquin vacated his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
appointment on being made Governor of Jamaica.
Colonel Sir Palmes Fairborne<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>, of the Queen's Regiment,
who succeeded to the command of the fortress on the
departure of the Earl of Inchiquin, was, in consequence
of his gallant and meritorious services, confirmed in the
appointment by his Majesty. The demise of this brave
officer, however, occurred before the commission for his
appointment was signed; he was wounded in an action
with the Moors on the 24th of October, 1680, and died
three days after, leaving the charge of the garrison to Lieutenant-Colonel
Edward Sackville, of the Coldstream Foot
Guards<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>. On the 27th of October the garrison attacked
the enemy's lines with determined bravery, and the Queen's
Regiment is reported to have '<em>behaved to admiration</em><a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>.'
Considerable loss was however sustained by the English;
'not above fifty men were left in one of the battalions
of Lord Inchiquin's Regiment (the Queen's): the
English and Scotch behaved as brave and gallant men,
and the Gentlemen Volunteers have alike proved themselves
men of courage.'</p>

<p>The Queen's Regiment had Ensign Watson, Ensign
Trent, and thirty-four men killed; and Captain Philpot,
Lieutenants Guy and Tate, Ensigns Roberts, Thomas,
Fitzpatrick, Webster, Norwood, Beckford, and Elliott,
with 124 men wounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">1681</div>

<p>In a short period after the above engagement, his
Majesty was pleased to appoint Lieutenant-Colonel Sackville
to be Lieutenant-Colonel of the Queen's Regiment of
Foot Guards, by which he was removed from service
at Tangier.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1682</div>

<p>The Government of Tangier was next conferred upon
Colonel Piercy Kirke<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>, who, on the death of the Earl
of Plymouth, had been promoted, on the 27th of November
1680, to the Colonelcy of the 2nd Tangier Regiment,
with which Regiment he had embarked for Africa as
Lieutenant-Colonel in September of that year. He was
removed to the Colonelcy of the Queen's Regiment on
the 19th of April, 1682, in succession to Colonel Sir
Palmes Fairborne, deceased.</p>

<p>During Colonel Kirke's services at Tangier, he had been
frequently employed upon missions to the Emperor of
Morocco. In Ockley's 'Account of South-west Barbary,'
there is a letter from the Emperor to him, dated the 27th
of October, 1682, which shows that there was a mutual
interchange of civilities between them; it is written to
acknowledge the receipt of a present of three English
horses, which, however thankful he might be, the Emperor
seems to think might have been improved upon, for he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
remarks, 'everybody knows that a carriage requires <em>four</em>
horses to travel.'</p>

<p>The support of the colony of Tangier appears to have
been a matter of serious dispute between the King and
the Parliament: repeatedly the King urged upon the
House of Commons the importance of the place, and the
House as often acknowledged it; but still withheld the
supplies necessary for its defence.</p>

<p>The advantage derived from the Levant trade, the fact
that two millions of money had been expended on the
works, and various arguments in favour of maintaining
Tangier, were at length fully set forth in a speech from
His Majesty on the 17th of November, 1680: a reply was
made to it in eighteen articles, but the following remarks
will sufficiently explain the whole affair, and account for
the final sacrifice of the colony:&mdash;</p>

<p>'It was said by the Parliament that the money granted
for works had been misapplied;&mdash;that the same thing
might happen again; and although they were, indeed,
afraid of Tangier, they were more afraid of a popish successor.&mdash;It
was a nursery, not only for popish soldiers,
but also for priests and religious persons too, and that
there had been sometimes a popish governor of the
place, so that to succour it was but to augment their
present evils.'</p>

<p>In December, 1680, and again, in a Royal Declaration,
dated the 8th of April, 1681, its great importance
was urged. At length, in 1683, the King, finding the
expense of maintaining the garrison and fortifications
greater than he was willing, or, unassisted by Parliament,
able to bear, came to the resolution of recalling
the one, and demolishing the other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1683<br />1684</div>

<p>About the end of the year 1683, Admiral Lord Dartmouth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
was sent to Tangier with twenty sail of the line,
with orders to demolish the fortress and mole, and to
bring away the inhabitants and garrison. Great sufferings
had been endured for some time for want of supplies
from England, and much joy was evinced by the former
on the announcement being made. In six months all the
arrangements to abandon this once favourite colony being
completed, the final evacuation took place in April, 1684.
The Portuguese government had offered a remuneration
to have Tangier restored to that nation, but their power
of defending it was questionable, and it was not considered
prudent to risk so important a fortress falling into the
hands of the Moors.</p>

<p>There are no means of ascertaining the number of
officers and men lost by the Queen's Regiment during
the twenty-two years of its service at Tangier; but to
judge from the casualties amongst officers of superior rank,
it must have been immense. The regiment had steadily
persevered in performing the arduous duties required of
it, and now retired from its post when a final evacuation
of the fortress took place, by the King's command.</p>

<p>The Queen's Regiment left Tangier in April, 1684;
and on its arrival in England it mustered 560 men, who
were portioned into 16 companies. This number was
part of 2300 troops, which had comprised the garrison
of Tangier, and which, beside the Queen's Regiment,
included</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>4 Troops of horse, which were incorporated in the
Royal Dragoons.</p>

<p>5 Companies of Foot Guards.</p>

<p>16 Companies of Earl of Dumbarton's (now 1st or
Royal Regiment).</p>

<p>16 Companies Trelawny's 2nd Tangier Regiment
(now 4th or King's Own).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>1 Company of Miners.</p>

<p>4 Independent Companies.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">1685</div>

<p>The want of confidence alluded to, as existing at this
epoch between the Court and Parliament of England,
did not terminate with the death of King Charles II.,
which event occurred on the 6th of February, 1685. His
successor King James II. had scarcely ascended his
throne, when the army was called upon to protect him
from the designs of disaffected subjects, headed by the
Duke of Monmouth, who had landed from Holland, and
raised the standard of rebellion in the west of England.
On this occasion the Queen's Regiment formed part of
the forces assembled under the Earl of Feversham, and it
is reported, that at the decisive battle of <em>Sedgemoor</em>, where
Monmouth and his party were defeated, and his cause
irretrievably ruined, 'the two Tangier regiments, Kirke's
and Trelawny's, did good service<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>.' Colonel Kirke was
promoted to the rank of Brigadier-General on the 11th
of May, 1685, and afterwards appointed to command at
Bridgewater.</p>

<p>Here we would willingly close the detail of this unfortunate
affair; but there have been too frequent allusions
to Kirke, and also to his regiment, by various historians,
as connected with subsequent proceedings in Monmouth's
rebellion to justify such a course. Lord Chief Justice
Jeffreys was appointed by King James to conduct a
special commission, and to pass judgment on the misguided
people who had aided the ill-fated Duke and his
adherents: Kirke with his regiment was ordered to escort
the judges in their circuit; numerous are the acts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
barbarity which history has handed down as perpetrated
by Jeffreys and Kirke in what were termed the 'bloody
assizes,' and we are told that no less than 261 persons
were executed. The remorseless character said to have
been evinced by Kirke on the occasion was supposed to
be the result of the long and sanguinary wars he had been
engaged in with the barbarians in Africa; but <em>Savage</em>,
in his history of Taunton, states, that 'on Kirke being
afterwards upbraided for his conduct by General Foulks,
he excused himself, and said he had an express order
from the King and his General, and that his commission
went further.' Kirke is represented as 'a loose and bold
soldier of fortune;' and there cannot be a doubt but he
made himself a willing agent to his ermined and sanguinary
coadjutor; but we are inclined to believe his vices
have been greatly exaggerated. The most outrageous
acts attributed to Kirke were said to have been perpetrated
in the neighbourhood of Taunton; and a piece of
ground, west of the castle, where he and his force were
cantoned, was called '<em>Tangier</em>,' in allusion to the services
of his regiment. Had the conduct of Colonel Kirke
approached the violence attributed to him, it is not very
probable that in the short space of four years it would
have been so lost sight of as to admit a demonstration
of joy similar to the following, noticed by the historian
of Taunton already quoted: 'The people of Taunton,
in commemoration of his (Kirke's) relieving Derry,
when besieged by James II. in 1689, devoted an evening
to the drinking of his health in public, the expenses
of which may be now seen in an old church book.' Zeal
for party, or misstatement, are at all times liable to disfigure
the pages of history; and if the case of Kirke is
not admitted as exemplifying this fact, a very short statement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
will show that the character of <em>his regiment</em> has
been unjustly implicated in these outrages. Dr. Toulmin
and other writers remark, that the name of '<em>lambs</em>' was
given by Colonel Kirke to his soldiers, who were most
ready to execute his cruel orders; but the truth is, that
the regiment, as already shown, had the device of a
<em>Lamb</em> on its colours and appointments from its first formation,
and continues to bear it to this day. From this
circumstance they were called 'The Lambs' long before
the period alluded to, and without any connexion with its
services in the West of England at this unhappy period.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1686</div>

<p>After the decease of King Charles II. this regiment
was styled '<em>The Queen Dowager's Regiment of Foot</em>.'
During the two years which followed Monmouth's rebellion,
the Queen Dowager's Regiment formed part of a
body of 12,000 troops assembled in camps for exercise on
Hounslow Heath. King James made great efforts to
ingratiate himself with this army: his success, as well as
his object, on the occasion, will be inferred from the following
remark given by Bishop Burnet&mdash;'That which
abated the King's joy in seeing so brave an army about
him, was, that it was visible, and on so many occasions,
that his soldiers had as great an aversion to his religion
as his other subjects had expressed.' An anecdote
related of Colonel Kirke is further illustrative of the
times:&mdash;when asked respecting a change of religion, he
is stated briefly to have replied, 'he was pre-engaged; for
he had promised the Emperor of Morocco, if ever he
changed his religion, he would turn <em>Mahomedan</em>.'</p>

<p>An attempt to displace Protestants from various situations,
civil and military, and to substitute Catholics,
as well as to force popish recruits into the army, and
other causes, at length brought on the <em>Revolution</em>; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
at this important crisis we find the Queen Dowager's
Regiment faithful to the best interests of its country.
The Prince of Orange (afterwards William III.) made
good his landing at Torbay early in November, 1688,
and marched to Exeter. The advanced position of
King James's army was at Warminster, and comprised
two battalions of Dumbarton's Regiment (the Royals)
and Kirke's (the Queen's), a troop of Life Guards,
and the Queen Consort's Regiment of Horse, now the
First Dragoon Guards. The whole was commanded by
Brigadier-General Kirke, who, on some frivolous pretence,
refused to march to Devizes, for which he was placed in
arrest, and ordered to London. The King, deserted by
many of his followers, and even by a portion of his
own family, adopted the resolution of retreating towards
London, and caused his forces to retire behind the Thames
to Staines and its neighbourhood; and ultimately, his
Majesty vacating his throne, without any government
being nominated, left the troops at liberty to use their
own discretion. Little opposition was made to the advance
of the Prince of Orange, who was soon joined by
Kirke, and the latter was received by his new monarch
with particular distinction.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1689</div>

<p>King James II., with a view of maintaining his
authority in Ireland, and assisted by Louis XIV., embarked
from France, and landed at Dublin in March,
1689. The Protestants in that country were determined
to resist his dominion, particularly at Londonderry,
where, under the gallant direction of the Rev.
George Walker, rector of Donoghmore, they nobly defended
that city for several months, notwithstanding
the Governor, Colonel Lundy, Colonel Thomas Cunningham,
9th Foot, and Colonel Solomon Richards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
17th Foot, had resolved, in a council of war, that the
place was not tenable, and that it would be imprudent
to land those two regiments which had been sent to their
assistance: these officers were in consequence cashiered,
and the most active measures were taken for sending a
further number of troops from England to the assistance
of the Protestants, and to the relief of Londonderry.</p>

<p>Major-General Kirke was appointed to the command
of the troops embarked on this service, on which the
Queen Dowager's Regiment was employed, and, with
Sir John Hanmer's (the 11th) Regiment, sailed from
Liverpool on the 21st of May. Great difficulties were
encountered in gaining access to Londonderry on account
of the batteries which had been erected on each side of
the river by the besieging army. At length the ship
Mountjoy, under convoy of the Dartmouth frigate, forced
a boom or barrier which had been placed across the
river to obstruct the entrance, and General Kirke succeeded
in landing men and provisions. The troops of
King James were so dispirited by the success of this
enterprize, that they abandoned the siege in the night,
and retired with precipitation, after having lost some
thousands of men before the place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1690</div>

<p>The Queen Dowager's Regiment continued in Ireland,
and served with distinction in the army of King William
at the battle of the <em>Boyne</em> on the 1st of July, 1690. It
was also employed in the siege of <em>Limerick</em>; in the relief
of <em>Birr</em>; and in December drove a division of the enemy
out of <em>Lanesborough</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1691</div>

<p>In 1691 four men per company were mounted, and
performed dragoon's duty<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>: the grenadier company
was also mounted. In February the mounted part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the regiment distinguished itself in an action at the
<em>Moat of Grenogue</em>; and the remainder of the regiment
took <em>Cairn Castle</em> and <em>Conway Castle</em>. In May the
regiment defeated a body of Rapparees near <em>Wyands-Town</em>.
It was afterwards employed at the siege of
<em>Athlone</em>, which was carried by storm on the 30th of June,
1691. It is recorded that 'never was a more desperate
service, nor was ever exploit performed with more
valour and intrepidity.' Lieut.-General De Ginkell,
to whom King William had entrusted the command of
his army, was created Earl of Athlone for his conduct
and success on this occasion. On the 4th of July ten
mounted grenadiers of the Queen's Regiment and twenty
horse, engaged 400 of the enemy's cavalry in the woods
of <em>Clanoult</em>, and displayed astonishing bravery. Our
men defended a bridge until half their numbers were
killed, and then retired.</p>

<p>The Queen Dowager's Regiment was engaged at the
decisive battle of <em>Aghrim</em>, in the county of Galway, on
the 12th of July, 1691, when the French General
St. Ruth was killed, and about 4000 of his troops. It
was also engaged in the second siege of Limerick; and
on the 22nd of September distinguished itself in an attack
upon the works which covered Thoumond Bridge. So
great was the loss of the enemy, that the place surrendered
a few days afterwards.</p>

<p>The ambition and power of Louis XIV. caused England
to unite with other nations to check the designs of
France, and in 1689 the Earl of Marlborough proceeded
to Flanders with several English regiments to
join the army of the confederacy. In 1691 King William
assumed the command of the allied forces in Flanders.</p>

<p>The war in Ireland having ended with the capitulation
of Limerick, King William was thereby enabled to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
withdraw some regiments from that country, and to
re-inforce his army in Flanders: the Queen Dowager's
Regiment was one of those selected for foreign service,
on which it immediately proceeded.</p>

<p>Lieutenant-General Kirke, who was promoted to that
rank on the 24th of December, 1690, joined the army
in Flanders, and died at Breda on the 31st of October,
1691. The Colonelcy of the Queen Dowager's Regiment
was conferred on Colonel William Selwyn, from the
Coldstream Foot Guards, on the 18th of December, 1691.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1692</div>

<p>In the spring of 1692, the preparations making by
Louis XIV. of France, and the late King James II., for
the invasion of England, caused King William to send
back some of the regiments, which had been sent from
Ireland to join the army in the Low Countries; amongst
others the Queen Dowager's returned, and was encamped
at Portsmouth. The glorious victory off La Hogue,
obtained at this critical period by the gallant exertions of
the fleet under Admiral Russell, dispelled all fear of invasion,
and distracted the councils of the enemy. Seven
thousand of the force assembled at Portsmouth, including
the <em>Queen Dowager's</em> Regiment, were embarked under
the Duke of Leinster with the intention of returning the
compliment by making a descent on the coast of France;
but this expedition being postponed, and ultimately abandoned,
in consequence of the lateness of the season, the
troops were ordered to proceed to Flanders. They landed
at Ostend on the 22nd of August, and took and fortified
the neighbouring towns of Furnes and Dixmude.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1693</div>

<p>The Queen Dowager's Regiment continued to form
part of the army on the continent, serving with distinction
in various operations there, and more particularly at the
battle of <em>Landen</em> on the 29th of July, 1693, where it was
posted in the left wing of the allied army, and in conjunction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
with the regiment of <em>Hamilton</em> (the Royals) defeated
a superior force of the enemy, and retarded, for a
time, the disasters of the day. Nothing could surpass
the courage and perseverance of King William, whose
presence with this portion of his troops urged them on
to deeds of the greatest heroism. At length, weakened
by repeated attacks from a far more numerous army, and
having their ammunition expended, they retired, leaving
their enemy little more than the name of a victory, for
the Duke of Luxembourg gained no advantages, and his
army had a greater number of officers and men killed
and wounded than the allies. The Queen Dowager's
Regiment lost in this battle Captain Collins, Captain
Sandys, Lieutenant Campbell, Ensign Burt, and about
100 men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1695</div>

<p>The Queen Dowager's had also the glory of being in
the line of circumvallation at the siege of <em>Namur</em>, and at
the reduction of that fortress in August, 1695, which event
was looked upon as one of the greatest in King William's
military life. <em>Namur</em> was so well furnished and prepared
for this attack, and so well situated, that the attempt to
reduce it was considered one of the utmost temerity. It
was defended by 15,000 chosen men, and commanded by
a Marshal of France (Boufflers) who 'made the point
one of the King's glory.' He was, however, forced to
capitulate, after losing nearly two-thirds of his garrison,
and the place was occupied by King William within two
months from his investing it. On this occasion Colonel
Selwyn, commanding the Queen's, was promoted to the
rank of Brigadier-General.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1696</div>

<p>In the winter of 1695-6, the king of France assembled
an army near Calais, for a descent upon England in
favour of King James, who had privately concerted
measures for a rebellion in this country, and had sent the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Duke of Berwick with a number of officers in disguise,
through whose persuasions 2000 men were prepared to
rise, at a moment's notice, under the directions of Sir
John Fenwick<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>; at the same time a conspiracy was
formed in London for the assassination of King William,
and fifty men were engaged and prepared with arms to
commit the diabolical act. The Queen Dowager's and
several other regiments were immediately ordered to
England to resist the threatened invasion. The plot was,
however, discovered; many of the conspirators were apprehended
and executed; and the designs of the enemy
frustrated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1697</div>

<p>The regiment remained in England until the summer
of 1697, when it again proceeded to the Netherlands,
joined the army encamped before Brussels on the 14th
of July, and on the 16th was reviewed by his Majesty.
This war was terminated in September by the Peace of
Ryswick; and the regiment returned to England the
same year. The establishment of the regiment after the
peace was 44 officers, and 884 non-commissioned officers
and men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1701</div>

<p>On the 28th of June, 1701, General Selwyn exchanged
from the Queen's to the 22nd Regiment of Foot, with
Sir Henry Bellasis, Kt.</p>

<p>The throne of Spain having become vacant by the
death of King Charles II., which took place in 1701,
the Duke of Anjou was crowned king, under the title
of Philip V., and was supported by his grandfather
Louis XIV. of France.</p>

<p>The conduct of France alarmed the other Powers of
Europe, and the death of the late King of England,
James II., having taken place at St. Germains on the
16th of September, 1701, the resentment of England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
against France was further called forth by Louis XIV.
having proclaimed his son, (the pretended Prince of
Wales) King of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and
having also influenced Spain to concur in the same affront
and indignity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1702</div>

<p>War was determined, and whilst active preparations
were making for prosecuting it, King William III. received
a fall from his horse, and his death took place
on the 8th of March, 1702. His policy was adopted
by his successor, Queen Anne, who entered into treaties
of alliance with the Emperor of Germany, the States
General of the United Provinces, and other princes and
potentates, for preserving the liberty and balance of
Europe, and for reducing the exorbitant power of France.</p>

<p>Declaration of war was accordingly proclaimed against
France and Spain on the 4th of May, 1702. The importance
of rescuing Spain from foreign oppression, and
of checking the ambitious views of France, was also
acknowledged by the English Parliament, and liberal
provision was made for increasing the means of prosecuting
the war with activity and vigour, both by sea
and land.</p>

<p>The Earl of Marlborough was appointed Commander-in-Chief
of the English troops in Holland, whither
he had proceeded as Ambassador Extraordinary and
Plenipotentiary, immediately after her Majesty's accession
to the throne.</p>

<p>In the beginning of June, 1702, it was arranged that
a naval force, consisting of fifty sail of the line, besides
frigates, under Admiral Sir George Rooke, and a land
force, consisting of nearly fourteen thousand men, under
the command of the Duke of Ormond, should proceed
to the coast of Spain. The following corps were employed
on this service; namely,&mdash;</p>

<p>The armament appeared off Cadiz on the 12th of
August, and the Duke summoned the place; but his
terms being refused, he landed on the 15th, between
Rota and Fort St. Catherine, where he encountered and
repulsed some Spanish cavalry. The next operation of
the army was the attack and capture of Fort St. Catherine
and of Port St. Mary; but the attempt on Cadiz failed.</p>

<p>Bishop Burnet, in alluding to this expedition, remarks&mdash;'It
is certain our court had false accounts of the state the
place was in, both with relation to the garrison and the
fortifications; the garrison was much stronger, and the
fortifications were in a better state than was represented.'
As a set-off to the miscarriage at Cadiz, the expedition
did good service and made a valuable conquest at Vigo
Bay, where the galleons from the West Indies, convoyed
by a French squadron, happened at this time to arrive<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>.
A passage of three quarters of a mile, which led into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
harbour of Vigo, was defended by forts on shore, and
secured by a boom extending across the channel; the
latter was also protected within by five line-of-battle ships,
and flanked by two others. To facilitate the attack on
this formidable barrier, the Duke of Ormond landed a
portion of his army six miles from Vigo, and took by assault
a battery of forty pieces of cannon, situated at the entrance
of the bay. A British ensign, hoisted on this fort, was
the signal for a general attack; the fleet in full sail approached,
broke the boom at the first shock, and became
closely engaged with the enemy's ships, whilst the British
troops that had landed stormed and captured the batteries.
After a vigorous defence, the French, finding they could
not escape, destroyed a part of their fleet; but ten ships
of war and eleven galleons were, notwithstanding, captured.
This glorious exploit was tarnished by some abuses practised
during the expedition; and so great was the plunder
at Port St. Mary, and at Vigo, that a proclamation was
issued for its recovery. Amongst others implicated in
those disgraceful acts was <em>Sir Henry Bellasis</em>, who was
second in command of the land forces, and was tried by a
court-martial on his return to England, and dismissed the
service. After this expedition the Queen Dowager's
Regiment was landed and stationed at Portsmouth<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1703</div>

<p>The Colonelcy of the Queen Dowager's Regiment was
next conferred on Lieutenant-General <em>David Colyear,
Earl of Portmore</em>, whose commission was dated the 27th
of February, 1703.</p>

<p>In the early part of the year 1703 Queen Anne augmented
her forces in the Netherlands. The Queen Dowager's
was one of the corps that proceeded from England on
the occasion, and joined the Duke of Marlborough, who
was in command of the allied army, and began operations
in the month of April. On the 10th of May following, the
Queen Dowager's Regiment had an opportunity of distinguishing
itself by a service, which evinced the utmost intrepidity
and discipline, and, in fact, saved part of the allied
army from being surprised by the enemy, and probably
from severe defeat. The <em>Duke of Marlborough</em>, being
engaged in the siege of <em>Bonn</em>, and the forces under
<em>Marshal D'Auverquerque</em> dispersed in quarters, the
French Marshals <em>Villeroy</em> and <em>Boufflers</em> determined to
attempt the surprise of the latter: by a night march they
arrived with a force of 40,000 men in the neighbourhood
of <em>Tongres</em>, which was occupied by two battalions of
foot,&mdash;one of <em>Elst</em>, (afterwards disbanded,) and the other
of <em>Portmore</em> (the Queen Dowager's).</p>

<p>The speedy reduction of <em>Tongres</em> was necessary to
the success of the French Marshals, and it was accordingly
attacked with great vigour; but the two regiments
defended themselves, with extraordinary bravery, <em>for
twenty-eight hours</em>; and when at length reduced to
surrender, they had secured time for <em>Marshal D'Auverquerque</em>
to collect his forces in a position under the
cannon of Maestricht, so strong, that the enemy declined
a general engagement.</p>

<p>For its conduct at Tongres the Queen Dowager's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Regiment was made <em>Royal</em>, and obtained the motto,
'<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pristinæ Virtutis Memor</i>.'</p>

<p>Shortly after the above gallant affair, the capture of the
fortress of <em>Huy</em> by the confederates enabled the Commander-in-Chief
to obtain the release of the brave corps
which had been made prisoners at <em>Tongres</em>, and the
following provision was made for that purpose; <em>viz.</em>:&mdash;
'The Governor, 900 men, and two Brigadier-Generals
to remain prisoners of war, till the two regiments taken
by the French at Tongres are released.' These terms
were speedily complied with.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1704</div>

<p>Archduke Charles of Austria having been acknowledged
as sovereign of Spain by a great part of Europe,
was seconded in his efforts to establish his claim by a
combined English and Dutch force, commanded by the
Duke of Schomberg; and he was further encouraged in
his undertaking by having Portugal for his ally. His
object, was to enter Spain by the Portuguese frontiers,
and the auxiliary force accordingly proceeded to Lisbon.
The Queen Dowager's was one of the regiments selected
for this service, and having embarked from Holland, the
regiment landed at Lisbon on the 16th of March, 1704.
The Duke of Schomberg was succeeded in his command
by the Earl of Galway, who advanced with the army to
the vicinity of Ciudad Rodrigo, but returned to Portugal
for winter quarters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1705</div>

<p>In the summer of 1705 the Queen Dowager's Regiment
was engaged in the siege of <em>Valencia de Alcantara</em>,
which place was taken by storm on the 8th of May.
The regiment was also employed in the siege and capture
of <em>Albuquerque</em>; and in the unsuccessful attack on
<em>Badajoz</em>, in which the Earl of Galway lost his right
hand by a cannon ball.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 31st of December, Catherine, Queen Dowager
of England, with whose history the early services of this
regiment were connected, and from whom its original
title and distinctions (as already remarked) were derived,
died at Lisbon. Her Majesty was Regent of
Portugal during the summer, (the king her brother
being with the army) and had proved herself firmly
attached to the interests of Great Britain<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1706</div>

<p>In April, 1706, the regiment was engaged in the
siege of <em>Alcantara</em>, in Spanish Estramadura, and on the
10th of that month distinguished itself in an attack on the
enemy's post at the Convent of St. Francis; it was afterwards
engaged in the siege and capture of <em>Ciudad
Rodrigo</em>; and subsequently advanced with the army to
Madrid.</p>

<p>This advance was in connexion with the operations of
Charles, Earl of Peterborough, and of the combined
English and Dutch fleets, the reduction of Barcelona,
and the conquest of Catalonia and Valencia,&mdash;features
important in history, which reflect the highest honour
on the British arms.</p>

<p>Success seemed secured to the allies, when the cause of
<em>King Charles III.</em>, who had been proclaimed at the
head of his victorious army at Madrid, was destroyed in
consequence of intrigue and want of unanimity; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
army was obliged to retire from the provinces it had conquered.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1707</div>

<p>In the spring of 1707 the army, commanded by the
Earl of Galway, under the orders of the Marquis das Minas,
invested Villena; at the same time the opposing army,
under the Duke of Berwick, advanced to <em>Almanza</em>, where
he was attacked by the allies on the 25th of April. The
enemy was considerably superior in numbers to the confederates.
Smollet remarks of this action, 'The English and
Dutch squadrons on the left, sustained by the Portuguese
horse of the second line, were overpowered after a gallant
resistance. The centre, consisting chiefly of battalions
from Great Britain and Holland, obliged the enemy to
give way, and move their first upon the second line; but
the Portuguese cavalry on the right being broken at
their first charge, their foot betook themselves to flight,
so that the English and Dutch troops being exposed
on the flanks, were surrounded and attacked on every
side. In this dreadful emergency they formed themselves
into a square, and retired from the field of battle.
By this time the men were quite spent with fatigue,
and their ammunition exhausted; they were ignorant
of the country, abandoned by their horse, destitute of
provisions, and out of all hope of supply. Moved by
these dismal considerations they capitulated, and surrendered
themselves prisoners of war, to the amount of
thirteen battalions.' In this disastrous battle the
allies lost 5000 men killed on the spot.</p>

<p>Of the Queen's Royal, Lieutenant Brady was killed;
Lieutenant-Colonel Kirke, Major Cullyford, Captains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Laton, Arnott, Hart, Gossin, Giles, and Phillips; Lieutenants
Jackson, Slack, May, Sawyers, Bracelay, Frazier,
and Arthlony; Ensigns Nichols, Brown, Graham, Johnson,
and Downs, and Surgeon Dalrimple, were made
prisoners of war.</p>

<p>The severe losses sustained on this occasion, and on
other services in Spain, induced the Earl of Galway to
order the Queen's Royal and the 9th Regiments of Foot,
after transferring their serviceable men to other regiments
in Spain, to return to England, for the purpose
of recruiting their ranks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1708</div>

<p>The regiment accordingly arrived in England in 1708,
and, by active exertions, its casualties were soon replaced,
and the men rendered fit to enter upon active service.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1710</div>

<p><em>Lieutenant-Colonel Piercy Kirke</em> was promoted Colonel
by purchase, on the 19th of September, 1710, <em>vice</em>
General the Earl of Portmore<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>. He was the son of its
old Colonel, Lieutenant-General Kirke, and had served
in the corps from the rank of Ensign, in 1686.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1711</div>

<p>In 1711 the regiment formed part of a force of 5000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
men ordered to proceed to America under General Hill,
and to make an attempt on Quebec, with the object of
effecting the conquest of Canada. A large fleet of
men-of-war formed part of the armament, which was to
be further strengthened by troops from the American
colonies. The expedition did not reach the river St.
Lawrence until the 21st of August, when it encountered
storms, and being furnished with bad pilots, eight
transports, a store ship, and a sloop were lost by shipwreck,
and 29 officers, 676 soldiers, and 35 women of the
4th, 37th, Colonel Kane's, and Colonel Clayton's regiments,
perished. There was also a scarcity of provisions.
It was therefore determined, in a council of war, that
further operations should be abandoned. Some of the
regiments engaged in the expedition proceeded to Annapolis
Royal, in Nova Scotia, but the Queen's returned
to England, and arrived at Portsmouth on the 9th of
October.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1712<br />1713</div>

<p>In consequence of the sudden death of the Emperor
Joseph of Austria, and the election of Charles III. of
Spain to the dignity of Emperor of the Romans, negociations
were entered into by England and France, and
hostilities were terminated by the peace of Utrecht, which
was concluded on the 31st of March, 1713. The Queen's
Royal were now permitted to remain for a period on
home-duty.</p>

<p>Queen Anne was not unmindful of the arduous and
faithful services which had been rendered by her troops
in time of need, and recommended them to the consideration
of parliament, as 'brave men who had exposed
their lives in the service of their country, and
could not be employed in time of peace.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">1714<br />1727</div>

<p>After the demise of her Majesty Queen Anne, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
1st of August, 1714, King George I. not having a
Queen Consort, this regiment was styled '<em>Her Royal
Highness the Princess of Wales's own Regiment of
Foot</em>;' and when the death of King George I. on the
11th of June, 1727, brought the Princess of Wales to
share the throne of England, its appellation was again
changed to '<em>The Queen's own Regiment of Foot</em>.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">1728</div>

<p>The Queen's own Regiment was reviewed on Blackheath,
in June, 1728, by his Majesty King George II.,
and furnished a guard of honour to her Royal Highness
the princess Amelia, during her residence at Tunbridge
Wells, in June and July, 1728.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1730</div>

<p>In June, 1730, the regiment embarked for Gibraltar,
and was employed in that fortress in 1740, when it was
blockaded by the Spaniards, with whom war had been
declared in 1739; but no serious impression was made
on the place at that time, nor at any subsequent period of
the war, which was terminated in 1748 by the treaty
of Aix-la-Chapelle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1741</div>

<p>Lieutenant-General Kirke, after commanding the regiment
upwards of thirty years, died on the 1st of
January, 1741; and was succeeded on the 12th of
August following by Colonel Thomas Fowke, from the
Forty-third Regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1749</div>

<p>In 1749, the year following the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle,
the regiment embarked from Gibraltar, and
proceeded to Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1751</div>

<p>Prior to 1751, the several regiments, both of cavalry
and infantry, had been called after the names of their
respective colonels: on the 1st of July of this year, a
royal warrant was issued, for regulating the clothing,
standards, guidons, colours, &amp;c., of regiments, in which
<em>numerical</em> titles were given to the regiments of horse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
dragoons, and foot. In this warrant the <em>Royal Regiment
of Foot</em>, from its antiquity, was numbered '<em>The First
Regiment of Foot</em>;' and the <span class="smcap">Queen's Royal</span> being the
next in seniority, was numbered '<em>The Second Regiment
of Foot</em>.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">1755</div>

<p>General Fowke was removed to the 14th Foot, and
was succeeded in the Colonelcy of the Second, or Queen's
Royal, on the 12th of November, 1755, by the Honourable
John Fitzwilliam.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1756</div>

<p>From the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, arts and sciences,
trade and manufactures, had greatly flourished in England,
and a rivalry existed with continental Europe for
pre-eminence in advancing refinements and civilization.
This prosperous state of things was interrupted in 1756
by war with France, and hostilities continued during
the remainder of the reign of George II., and for three
years in the reign of his successor George III. Peace
was restored in 1763 by the treaty of Paris. This war
had been pursued with vigour by Great Britain, whose
fleets and armies triumphed in all quarters of the
world. The Queen's Regiment was kept on duty in
Ireland, which country was threatened by France with
invasion. That nation, however, found sufficient occupation
for her troops elsewhere, and the threat of invasion,
as on other occasions, terminated on the part of France
in wasteful preparations and presumptuous boast.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1760</div>

<p>Major-General the Honourable John Fitzwilliam was
removed to the 2nd Irish Horse, (now the 5th Dragoon
Guards) and was succeeded by Sir Charles Montague,
K.B., on the 27th of November, 1760.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1765</div>

<p>The Queen's Royal Regiment continued in Ireland
until June, 1765, when it was removed to the Isle of
Man, where it remained until 1768.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1768</div>

<p>In February, 1768, it was removed from the Isle of
Man to Cork, whence it embarked for Gibraltar to
relieve the 54th Regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1775</div>

<p>It remained at Gibraltar until 1775, when it returned
to England and landed at Portsmouth on the 26th of
December of that year. Lieutenant-Colonel Oswald,
who was then in command of the regiment, issued, previous
to its landing, some orders, expressing, among
other things, his hope that the corps would insure its
welcome to England, <em>after an absence of half a century</em>,
by the closest attention to its duties, both civil and
military.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1776</div>

<p>The first quarters occupied by the Queen's Royal on
its return to England were at Alton and Farnham, from
whence the regiment marched, on the 9th of May, 1776,
on a route for the north. Passing through London, the
regiment was reviewed by its Colonel, Sir Charles Montague,
on the 14th, and by his Majesty King George III.
on the 17th of the same month, and arrived on the 26th
of July at Tynemouth barracks, where it continued three
years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1777</div>

<p>Sir Charles Montague<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> dying in 1777, Lieutenant-General
Daniel Jones was promoted from the Third Foot
Guards to the Colonelcy of the Queen's Royal on the
7th of August of that year.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">1779</div>

<p>In the summer of 1779 the Queen's Royal was one
of the regiments of the line and militia assembled in the
camp of exercise on Warley Common, after which it was
quartered in Rumford, Ongar, and Epping.</p>

<p>On the breaking out of the riots in London in 1780,
the Queen's Regiment was among the troops ordered to
the metropolis, and encamped in Hyde Park on the 7th
of June, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel
William Dalrymple, on which occasion it received the
thanks of Major-General Rainsford for its regularity and
good conduct. On the breaking up of the camp in Hyde
Park in August following, the Queen's Regiment, with a
large portion of the troops proceeded to Finchley Common.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1783<br />1790</div>

<p>The regiment remained in England until the autumn
of 1783, when it again embarked for Gibraltar; and
during the time of its service in that garrison, his Royal
Highness Prince Edward (afterwards Duke of Kent)
having arrived, was appointed to the command of the
Queen's, as appears from the following order, dated the
26th of February, 1790:&mdash;'His Royal Highness Prince
Edward is posted to the Queen's Royal Regiment, of
which he is to take command until further orders.' In
the ensuing August the command of the regiment was
resumed by Lieutenant-Colonel Woollicombe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1792</div>

<p>The regiment embarked from Gibraltar on the 25th
of March, 1792, and landed at Portsmouth on the 24th
of April following, where it went into barracks. On the
22nd of July it was encamped at Wickham Bushes,
near Bagshot, under the Duke of Richmond, with two
battalions of Royal Artillery, the 3rd, 14th, and 29th
regiments, where it was reviewed by his Majesty; after
the breaking up of the camp it returned to Portsmouth.</p>

<p>The repose granted to England by the peace of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
1763 was, a few years after that period, interrupted
by legislative differences with the North American
Colonies, and at length by measures, which led to a
desperate and sanguinary war. Hostilities were commenced
in 1775, and terminated in 1783, with the loss
to Great Britain of that large portion of territory, <em>the
United States of America</em>. During this important
struggle, France had afforded active assistance in promoting
the disunion of England and her American
subjects. A spirit of republicanism soon afterwards
began to spread in France. Anarchy, revolution, and
bloodshed, and the execution of their king, followed in
rapid succession. The latter act took place in 1793,
and was the immediate cause of a war on the part of
Great Britain and of Europe, against France.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1793<br />1794</div>

<p>In February, 1793, the Queen's Regiment was ordered
to Dover and Folkstone to do duty over French prisoners
of war. While on this duty, two of the newly-raised
independent companies were added to the regiment, and
a brigade of six-pounders attached to it. In August
following it was embarked, with the exception of the
staff, to serve as marines in the fleet under Admiral Earl
Howe, and shared in the glorious victory over the French
fleet on the 1st of June, 1794, which Earl Howe completely
defeated, and seven of the enemy's ships were
captured. Lieutenant John Neville, of the Queen's
Royals, was killed on board the <i>Charlotte</i>, and Ensign
Boycott was wounded on board the <i>Defence</i>. The gallant
Admiral, in his public dispatch of the 2nd of June,
expressed his thanks to the crews and military corps for
the highly distinguished examples of resolution, perseverance,
and spirit testified by them in the actions of
the 28th and 29th of May, and the 1st of June.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>Lieutenant-General Jones<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> died on the 20th of November,
1793, and was succeeded in the Colonelcy of the
regiment by Major-General Alexander Stewart.</p>

<p>The regiment continued to serve on board the fleet
until the 24th of November, 1794, when, <em>with the exception
of two companies</em>, it was re-landed, and, by the
incorporation of some independent companies, augmented
to twelve companies, of four serjeants, two drummers,
and 100 rank and file each. Of these, the <em>ten companies</em>
on shore were formed into a <em>Second Battalion</em>,
as appears by the Adjutant-General's letter of the 29th
of November. Some time, however, elapsed before the
regiment had either two pair of colours, or the staff of
two battalions; but the corps, thus formed, was designated
the <em>Second Battalion</em>, while the <em>two companies</em>,
which remained doing marine duty on board the fleet,
continued the nucleus of the <em>First Battalion</em>, waiting
an opportunity, when their services should be no longer
required as marines, to be filled up, which took place in
the following year.</p>

<p>On the 20th of December, 1794, Major-General James
Coates was appointed Colonel, vice Major-General Alexander
Stewart, deceased<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 25th of December the <em>Second Battalion</em>
embarked, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel
the Earl of Dalhousie, for the West Indies, and arrived
in Carlisle Bay, Barbadoes, on the 29th of March, 1795.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1795</div>

<p>The year in which the regiment arrived in the West
Indies was rendered remarkable by a series of brilliant
achievements performed by the British forces serving in
that part of his Majesty's dominions; and the valuable
French possessions of Martinique and Guadaloupe were
but a part of the captures made by the army and fleet
under their respective commanders, General Sir Charles
Grey and Admiral Sir John Jervis.</p>

<p>The National Convention, which at this period
governed France, although busily and successfully employed
in extending revolutionary power in Europe, was
not indifferent to the events above alluded to; and an
expedition to the West Indies was despatched from
Brest, commanded by the famous Victor Hughes, a
republican commissioner, for the purpose of recovering
the conquered islands. A force of 2000 French troops
arrived at Guadaloupe, and were quickly reinforced by
a multitude of Mulattoes and Blacks, who were speedily
clad in uniforms. Among this motley group, comprising
slave and freeman, the doctrines of liberty and
equality were disseminated, and led to a rapid overthrow
of regular government, and to a frightful catalogue of
outrages and disasters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>The same spirit of disorganization that devastated
Guadaloupe was soon spread, through the instrumentality
of agents, to the other conquered islands, and thus
tended to weaken the power of the English forces at the
principal point of attack:&mdash;added to this circumstance,
the ranks of the British battalions had been thinned by
an epidemic, most malignant in its nature, and it was
found impossible to oppose an effectual resistance to the
accumulated force which now assailed them. The island
of Martinique was the only settlement that could be
preserved, and this was not done without great exertions
of the British troops, ably supported by the colonists.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Queen's Royal</span> had proceeded to Martinique
shortly after its arrival in the West Indies; and so great
had been its sufferings, that, at the termination of 1795,
the total strength of the battalion in that country was
reduced to 162 men, and of those, two serjeants and
four privates were afterwards killed in an engagement
with the French brigands at Vaughlin, and in the same
affair we find Lieutenant-Colonel Lord Dalhousie numbered
with the wounded.</p>

<p>In the month of July, 1795, the two flank companies
of the regiment, already mentioned as being left on board
the Fleet, were disembarked at Guernsey, and proceeded
in the month following to Southampton: they
had been augmented, and now formed the <em>First Battalion</em>
of the regiment, which was already in a state of readiness
for foreign service. In October, eight companies
of the First Battalion, under Lieutenant-Colonel Harris,
embarked, and formed part of the memorable expedition
destined for the West Indies, under Major-General Sir
Ralph Abercrombie and Admiral Christian.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1796</div>

<p>On this occasion about 16,000 troops were collected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
at Portsmouth, and on the 18th of November the fleet
containing them stood down the Channel, but in a few
hours it was overtaken by a dreadful hurricane, which
caused many ships laden with men to be wrecked,
and the coast about Weymouth to be strewed with
dead bodies. Amongst the transports lost, was that
having on board the flank companies of the <em>First Battalion</em>
of the <span class="smcap">Queen's</span>, who were afterwards collected at
Plymouth, and commanded by Major Eyre. No further
attempt was made to forward this portion of the regiment
to its previous destination; but the six companies,
under Lieutenant-Colonel Harris, proceeded
onwards with the fleet, and in February, 1796, were
landed at Martinique, where they formed a junction
with the <em>Second Battalion</em>, serving in that island.</p>

<p>In addition to this timely reinforcement, the <em>Second
Battalion</em>, during its service in the West Indies, was
augmented by drafts from the Forty-sixth and Sixty-first
regiments, and also by men of different regiments who
had been prisoners at Guadaloupe, and who had been
exchanged.</p>

<p>By Returns of the battalion in the West Indies, made
at the above period, its casualties for a half year,

<p>In 1797 the Second Battalion of the <span class="smcap">Queen's</span> formed
part of the expedition when Sir Ralph Abercrombie
captured the Spanish island of Trinidad; and in the
course of the same year, the serviceable men were transferred
to the Fifty-seventh regiment, and the battalion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
comprising altogether seventy persons, was embarked,
and returned to Europe.</p>

<p>The flank companies, which had been wrecked and
left in England, were made the basis of another <em>First
Battalion</em>, which was formed accordingly, and removed
from Plymouth to Lyndhurst and Lymington.</p>

<p>In March, 1797, Lord Dalhousie, who had a short
time previously returned from the West Indies, assumed
the command of the <em>First Battalion</em>, which was marched
to Tiverton, where it was brigaded with the Twenty-ninth
and Fifty-eighth Regiments.</p>

<p>The quarters of the <span class="smcap">Queen's Royal</span>, during the year
1797, continued in the western district, and in June the
regiment moved to Plymouth Lines.</p>

<p>When the mutiny broke out in the fleets at Spithead
and the Nore, and attempts were made to disseminate
seditious publications among the soldiery, Lieutenant-Colonel
Lord Dalhousie, and the Captains of the <span class="smcap">Queen's
Royal</span>, addressed a letter to the General Commanding
the district, expressive of their firm reliance on the unshaken
loyalty of the corps; at the same time, the non-commissioned
officers and privates subscribed the sum
of one hundred guineas to be applied towards the detection
and punishment of any persons who should attempt
to distribute unlawful papers, or offer, by bribes or any
other means, to seduce the soldiers from their allegiance.
The letter from the Lieutenant-Colonel and Captains,
as also the resolution of the men, signed by the Serjeant-Major,
Michael Eager, were entered, by order of the
Colonel, in the Orderly Book of the regiment.</p>

<p>The latter document is transcribed into this record,
as characteristic of British soldiers, who, in periods of
political excitement, do not permit themselves to be withdrawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
from the fidelity and allegiance which they owe to
their Sovereign, whom they have sworn to defend against
all enemies.</p>

the West Indies, joined the corps at Penzance, and the
whole were incorporated into one battalion. In December
the regiment was again marched to Plymouth, to do
duty in Mill Prison; and on the 25th of the same month
twelve lieutenants and two companies were reduced.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1798</div>

<p>In February, 1798, the Queen's received orders to
hold itself in readiness for embarkation. It was brigaded
at Plymouth with the Twenty-fifth and Twenty-ninth,
under the command of Lord Dalhousie, in March;
and on the 12th of June following embarked at Barnstaple,
under Lieutenant-Colonel Eyre, for Ireland, where
republican principles had gained ground, and being
encouraged by promised aid from France, the malcontents
broke into acts of open rebellion. The regiment
landed in Ireland on the 20th of February, and
arrived at Fowke's Mill in the middle of the action
between Major-General Sir John Moore and the rebels.
On the next day, the army moved on to Wexford, which
Lord Dalhousie entered with the flank companies of the
<span class="smcap">Queen's Royal</span>, and liberated Lord Kingsborough,
and several other Protestant gentlemen, who were to
have been put to death. Lieutenant Charles Turner<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>,
of the <span class="smcap">Queen's Royal</span>, was one of the officers who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
a few days after, surprised and took prisoner the celebrated
<em>Bagenal Harvey</em>, who had concealed himself in
a cave in Saltee Island, and whose character for courage
and desperation was such that few people would have
ventured to approach his hiding-place.</p>

<p>When the French expedition under General Humbert
landed in Ireland in July, 1798, the <span class="smcap">Queen's
Royal</span> marched to Tuam, where the army assembled.
After the surrender of General Humbert, the regiment
returned to Phillipstown, and wintered in Kilkenny,
where they were brigaded with the Twenty-ninth regiment,
under Major-General Peter Hunter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1799</div>

<p>In the early part of the following year, the brigade,
with some guns, marched to Tullamore and to Phillipstown,
to be ready in case of a rising in that part of the
country: this, although apprehended, did not take place,
and in six weeks the brigade returned to Kilkenny, and
in June the <span class="smcap">Queen's</span> moved from thence to Cork, and
encamped at Monkstown.</p>

<p>In the month of July, the regiment embarked for
England, landed at Southampton, and marched to the
camp on Barham Downs, near Canterbury, where it was
recruited by volunteers from the militia; and with the
Twenty-seventh, Twenty-ninth, and Eighty-fifth regiments,
it formed the third brigade of the army commanded
by Major-General Coote. With this brigade,
to which the Sixty-ninth regiment was afterwards added,
it served during the expedition to Holland, and was
engaged with the enemy at the Helder, on the 27th of
August, 1799, when the army commanded by Sir Ralph
Abercrombie made good its landing, in defiance of great
natural obstacles at the point of debarkation, and also
made an advanced movement, in opposition to every
exertion on the part of an active enemy, to prevent it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>A detail of this gallant exploit states, 'the first
success of this day was principally owing to General
Coote's brigade, and the advance, consisting of the 23rd
and 55th regiments, commanded by Colonel Macdonald,
who, instead of waiting the attacks of the enemy,
advanced on every occasion to meet them.' These
brave efforts cost the British forces a loss of about 500
men.</p>

<p>In subsequent operations, during this arduous expedition,
the <span class="smcap">Queen's Royal</span> had the honour of contributing
a full portion of its services, and was present
when his Royal Highness the Duke of York, in Command
of the Anglo-Russian forces, on the 2nd of October,
1799, gained a decided victory at Egmont-op-Zee, over
a numerous army opposed to him on that occasion.
Alluding to this action, his Royal Highness observes,
'Under Divine Providence, this signal victory, obtained
over the enemy, is to be ascribed to the animated and
persevering exertions which have been at all times the
characteristics of the British soldier, and which, on no
occasion, were ever more eminently displayed; nor
has it often fallen to the lot of any general to have
such just cause of acknowledgment for distinguished
support.'</p>

<p>On the 6th of October the French and Dutch armies
again contested the field with their opponents, and were
once more forced by British valour to retire. In his
report of this victory, the Duke of York remarks, that
'the gallantry the troops displayed, and the perseverance
with which they supported the fatigues of the day,
rival their former exertions.' The loss of the <span class="smcap">Queen's
Royal</span> in this action proves they were honourable
competitors for glory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the successes of the British forces,
they were precluded from a further advance, and from
profiting by the just reward of their labours, in consequence
of the lateness of the season, and the difficulty
of obtaining supplies during the winter; besides which,
the French army was receiving large reinforcements.</p>

<p>These and other causes induced his Royal Highness
to desist from further offensive operations, and finally
led to the withdrawing of the Anglo-Russian army from
Holland, and to the termination of an expedition which,
although unattended with full success, evinced distinguished
merit and bravery on the part of the British
commander and his army.</p>

<p>Nor must it be omitted, in alluding to this expedition,
that at this period the old regiments had been considerably
reduced by the arduous services against St. Domingo
and the French West India islands, and were
now chiefly made up from volunteers from the militia,
hastily got together, and employed in active offensive
operations before they could be properly organised and
rendered fit for such duty.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these disadvantages, the British
troops employed in Holland upheld, by their gallantry
and discipline, the honour of their country, and by the
skill and attention of their officers, this short but active
campaign prepared this little army to advance the glory
of England in succeeding years, against the best organised
troops in Europe.</p>

<p>Major-General Coote expressed, in orders, his approbation
of the conduct of the <span class="smcap">Queen's Royal</span>; and after
the evacuation of Holland, the regiment landed at Yarmouth,
from whence it proceeded to Ashford, in Kent,
for the winter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1800</div>

<p>In May, 1800, the <span class="smcap">Queen's Royal</span> marched to
Plymouth, and embarked on board the Europa and
Thisbe, on a flying expedition, under the command of
General Sir Thomas Maitland and Admiral Sir Edward
Pellew, which was employed in making descents upon
the coast of France, and destroying batteries and small
crafts. In this service, Major Ramsay, of the <span class="smcap">Queen's</span>,
led some successful attacks, and on one occasion (as recorded
in 'Baine's History of the Wars') 'he seized
several sloops and gun-vessels, and burned a national
corvette of eighteen guns, by means of a detachment
from the <span class="smcap">Queen's</span> Regiment, assisted by the gun-launches
under Lieutenant Pinfold.'</p>

<p>On the 15th of June, the regiment was encamped in
the island of Houat, preparatory to an intended attack
upon Belle Isle; but the plan was abandoned; the
regiment re-embarked, and, with other corps, to the
number of 5000 men, sailed, under the command of the
Earl of Dalhousie, to reinforce Sir Ralph Abercrombie
at Minorca, where it arrived on the 19th of July.</p>

<p>On the 29th of August, 1800, it was again on ship-board,
forming part of the expedition against Cadiz, on
the abandonment of which it became necessary to dispose
of this force, which, although small, was considered the
corps d'élite of England, and included almost the entire
disposable force of the country.</p>

<p>The attention of Sir Ralph Abercrombie was directed
towards the Mediterranean, and the reduction of Malta
encouraged an expedition to that quarter. At this time
Egypt was occupied by 30,000 French veterans, emboldened
by conquest, and inured to the climate of the
country. They had been taken from that army which,
under Napoleon Bonaparte, had astonished Europe by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
its successes in Italy and in Germany, and they were
now awaiting a favourable opportunity to forward the
ambitious projects that had been planned for them by
their great leader, who had exultingly named them '<em>The
army of the East</em>.'</p>

<p>The attention of all Europe was directed to the
struggle about to take place, in which the ambition of
Bonaparte was supposed to have attained a crisis, and
the <em>fate of Asia</em> was to be decided <em>on the shores of
Africa</em>, by the two most powerful European nations.</p>

<p>A British army, amounting to about 15,000 men,
assembled under Sir Ralph Abercrombie, at Marmorice
Bay, on the coast of Asiatic Turkey, towards the end of
December, 1800.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1801</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Queen's Royal</span> Regiment had proceeded from
Cadiz to Gibraltar and Minorca, from whence it sailed to
Malta, and now formed part of the above force. Some
weeks were lost at Marmorice, in expectation of receiving
reinforcements of Greeks and Turks; and the expedition
did not proceed to its final destination until the 23rd
of February, 1801. On the 1st of March it anchored
in the bay of Aboukir, eastward of Alexandria; but notwithstanding
all the exertions of the navy under Admiral
Lord Keith's orders, the necessary arrangements could
not be made for landing the troops, chiefly in consequence
of unfavourable weather, until the 8th of March.
On the morning of that day a signal rocket caused 150
boats, laden with 5000 men, to approach the shore.
The clear silence of the morning broken by the deep murmur
of thousands of oars urging forward the flower of a
brave army, whose polished arms glittered in the rays of
the morning sun, produced an interesting scene:&mdash;the floating
battalions drew near the shore, which was crowded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
with French troops; a combat ensued; and the bay of
Aboukir resounded to the roar of cannon.</p>

<p>A body of French troops, supported by several batteries,
awaited the arrival of their enemies, but were forced to
give way in defiance of every exertion, and after severe
loss. The loss of the British amounted to 576 rank and
file, in killed, wounded, and missing.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Queen's Royal</span> Regiment was first employed under
the command of Sir Sydney Smith, at the siege of Fort
Aboukir; but on the 12th of March, seven companies,
under Lieutenant-Colonel Jones, were ordered to join the
army, and arrived in time to take a share in the victory
of the 13th of March. The other three companies of
the regiment remained with the Twelfth Light Dragoons
(dismounted) before Aboukir, until the surrender of that
fort on the 19th of March. The regiment was afterwards
attached to the fourth brigade, under Major-General Sir
John Doyle's command, and was present at the glorious
Battle of <span class="smcap">Alexandria</span>, on the 21st of March; when a
protracted and well-contested fight terminated in victory
to the British troops after a loss of between 1400 and
1500 men.</p>

<p>After the battle of the 21st of March, the <span class="smcap">Queen's
Royal</span> was detached, with the flank companies of the
Fortieth regiment, under Colonel Spencer, to <em>Rosetta</em>,
and was employed in the reduction of that town, and of
the fortress of <em>St. Julien</em>, which commanded the navigation
of the Nile, on which occasion one of the '<em>French
Invincible Standards</em>' was taken. The Regiment then
proceeded with the army towards Cairo, and was engaged
in the affair at <em>Rahmanie</em>,&mdash;the capture of the
French convoy in the Desert,&mdash;at the surrender of <em>Cairo</em>&mdash;and
in the escort of the French garrison from that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
city to its place of embarkation. Subsequently, the
regiment joined that part of the army which was
engaged in the blockade of <em>Alexandria</em>, and was attached
to the reserve brigade commanded by Major-General
(afterwards Sir John) Moore. Alexandria surrendered
on the 2nd of September, 1801, and the <span class="smcap">Queen's Royal</span>
was ordered to Fort Pharos, at the entrance of the harbour,
where it continued until the following December.</p>

<p>In this campaign, the severe loss sustained by the
British army in their active operations against the enemy
was greatly augmented by deaths caused by fatigue, as
well as by the climate of Egypt. The casualties in the
<span class="smcap">Queen's</span> were 36 killed and 70 wounded<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>.</p>

<p>In the action of the 21st of March, Lieut.-General Sir
Ralph Abercrombie, the commander-in-chief of the army,
received a mortal wound, and died on the 28th of the same
month. His merits are attested in General Orders issued
to the army on the 16th of May, 1801<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>, and in the dispatch
of his successor, General Hutchinson, in the
following terms: 'His memory will be recorded in the
annals of his country, will be sacred to every British
soldier, and embalmed in the recollection of a grateful
posterity.' The same officer adds, 'It is impossible
for me to do justice to the zeal of the officers, and to
the gallantry of the soldiers, of this army.'</p>

<p>By the conquest of Egypt, Great Britain effected a
revolution, which, in a great degree, influenced the politics
of nations throughout the world. The vaunting ambition
of France received a timely check, by the defeat of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>boldest project which the mind of her greatest General
had ever conceived; and the '<em>Army of the East</em>' returned
to their country, relieved, in a short campaign, of the
fruits of four years' toil and glory.</p>

<p>The successful efforts of the British fleet and army
were followed by a treaty of peace with France, which
was concluded at Amiens on the 1st of October, 1801,
by which Egypt was again restored to the Ottoman
empire. The troops, as opportunities offered, were withdrawn
from the scene of their brilliant achievements,
and about the end of the year 1801 the Queen's Regiment
embarked for Gibraltar.</p>

<p>The peace concluded at the above period was, however,
of short duration, and did not tend to check the
hostile spirit of Bonaparte, whose perfidious conduct
and insatiable ambition rendered an appeal to arms
again necessary, and Great Britain was obliged to declare
war against France in May, 1803.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1802<br />1804</div>

<p>From the spring of 1802 until the end of 1805, the
<span class="smcap">Queen's Royal</span> formed part of the garrison of Gibraltar,
and was highly complimented by his Royal Highness
the Duke of Kent, for its loyalty, steadiness, and good
conduct throughout the mutiny which occurred there.
By the malignant fever which raged with great violence
in that garrison in 1804, it lost in a few weeks one
captain, six subalterns, and about 90 men, besides women
and children.</p>

<p>While the regiment was at Gibraltar, the officers
received permission to wear the medals which had been
presented to them by the Grand Signior, for their services
in the Egyptian campaign.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1805</div>

<p>In November, 1805, the regiment embarked for England.
One of the transports, having on board the two
flank companies, and one battalion company under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
command of Captain Wilson, was taken on the 15th of
December by the squadron of the French Admiral, Guillaumet,
consisting of six sail of the line (one commanded
by Jerome Buonaparte) and several frigates. The captured
companies were put on board La Voluntaire frigate,
where they remained prisoners about three months: they
were subsequently restored to liberty in consequence of
that vessel putting into the Cape of Good Hope, which
she expected to find a friendly port, but which had surrendered
a short time before to the British forces under
Lieut.-General Sir David Baird and Admiral Sir Home
Popham. At the Cape these companies remained about
seven months, when they embarked once more for England,
and rejoined the regiment in April, 1807.</p>

<p>In the mean time the head-quarters and the remainder
of the regiment had landed, in December, 1805, at
Portsmouth, its strength amounting to 20 officers,
31 serjeants, 12 drummers, and 289 rank and file.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1806</div>

<p>In January, 1806, the regiment received new colours,
on which, in addition to former devices, were the <span class="smcap">Sphynx</span>,
and the word <span class="smcap">Egypt</span>, granted to it by his Majesty, in
consideration of its distinguished conduct in that country
in 1801, as already detailed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1807</div>

<p>In 1807 the establishment of the regiment was 696.
In the month of June of that year it embarked for
Guernsey, and remained there till June of the following
year, receiving, during its stay in that island, 330 general-service
men from the depôt in the Isle of Wight, and
above 150 militia volunteers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1808</div>

<p>In June, 1808, the regiment returned to England,
860 rank and file strong, and was quartered at Ipswich,
until the 18th of July, when it was brigaded with the
Twentieth Foot and a battalion of the Ninety-fifth Rifles,
under the command of Major-General Acland, and embarked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
at Harwich for Portugal, to join the forces about
to be assembled in that country.</p>

<p>The peace of Tilsit, which was concluded at this period
between France and other continental powers, gave a
more determined character to the war pursuing between
England and France. Napoleon, who by this time had
become sensible of his inability successfully to invade
Great Britain, sought the humiliation of his rival in
excluding, by the above treaty, the manufactures of
England from the markets of Europe. As a part of his
scheme for universal empire, he gained the royal family
of Spain into his power by treachery, placed his brother
Joseph on the throne of that kingdom by force, and
effected the conquest of Portugal. Such acts of tyrannical
ambition failed not to rouse the just resentment of
England, and led to the bold determination of rescuing
the Peninsula from the rapacious conqueror. Portugal
was destined to receive the advance-guard of a British
army, which, as in Egypt, was to encounter the victorious
legions of Napoleon, and, as in Egypt, also to
triumph. On the 1st of August, 1808, a body of British
troops, commanded by Major-General Sir Arthur Wellesley,
landed near Lisbon, and on the 17th of the same
month they defeated a French force at <em>Roleia</em>. At this
first meeting of the great rival powers, a severe struggle
terminated in favour of English valour, and was a faithful
precursor of the ability of the commander, and of the
successes which were to accompany the gallant army on
their future career.</p>

<p>After a tedious passage from England, Major-General
Acland's brigade arrived in a small bay near Peniché,
where it landed in the night of the 20th of August, and
in a few hours joined the army under Sir Arthur
Wellesley, in time to share the honours and triumphs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
of the memorable battle of <em>Vimiera</em>. The brigade underwent
much fatigue, and suffered some loss; and the
General's dispatches bear evidence that it did its duty.
After the convention of Cintra, by which Portugal was
delivered from the power of France, the <span class="smcap">Queen's Royal</span>
crossed to Old Lisbon, and marched to escort prisoners
of war from Fort La Lippe. His Majesty has graciously
permitted the regiment to bear the word <em>Vimiera</em> on its
colours and appointments, in commemoration of its
gallantry in that battle.</p>

<p>In the autumn, when the army under Lieutenant-General
Sir John Moore advanced from Lisbon into Spain,
the <span class="smcap">Queen's</span> formed part of Sir John Hope's division,
which protected the march of the artillery by the south
bank of the Tagus to Talavera de la Reyna, and from
thence by the pass of the Guadarrama mountains, to form
a junction at Salamanca with the Commander-in-Chief,
the same being the only route considered passable for
heavy guns.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1809</div>

<p>Before the British troops were concentrated at Salamanca,
the Spanish force which was to have co-operated
with them had ceased to exist; it had been attacked,
defeated, and dispersed by the French, who had 300,000
men in Spain. Sir John Moore, however, advanced with
his army of about 23,000 men, until Bonaparte directed
80,000 veterans with 200 cannon against him: a retreat
was immediately commenced. In all the fatigues, distresses,
and privations of this memorable winter campaign,
the <span class="smcap">Queen's</span> regiment had its full share, and was brigaded
with the 5th, 14th, and 32nd regiments under command of
Major-General (now Lord) Hill. This brigade was posted
in line on the left of Sir John Moore's position, when that
officer fought and defeated the French forces in front of
<em>Corunna</em> on the 16th of January, 1809. The glory of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
day was clouded by the loss of many brave soldiers,
among whom the British army had to lament the death
of its gallant commander<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>.</p>

<p>The withdrawing of the British troops from Spain
after the battle of <em>Corunna</em> was the consequent operation
of Sir John Moore's retreat to the coast: arrangements
for this purpose were therefore hastily concerted,
and as speedily acted upon. A great portion of the army
was enabled to embark in the harbour of Corunna during
the night after the battle; at the same time General
Hill's brigade retired to a position near the ramparts of
the town, leaving the piquets of the brigade, under
Lieutenant-Colonel Kingsbury, of the Queen's Regiment,
employed as a rear-guard to cover the retreat of the
army, and to keep the enemy in check by fires and other
stratagems, until the embarkation was completed, almost
without molestation; and General Hill's brigade followed
from the citadel on the succeeding day. The troops
embarked in such vessels as they could reach; the ships
made the best of their way to England, and, in consequence
of the stormy season, landed the troops at the first port
they could gain. The Queen's Regiment arrived in
parties, and was subsequently re-united at Ipswich.</p>

<p>In consequence of the gallant conduct of the <span class="smcap">Queen's
Royal</span> in the action at Corunna, the regiment has
received his Majesty's permission for the word <em>Corunna</em>
being borne on its colours and appointments<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>A detachment of the <span class="smcap">Queen's Royal</span> had been left
in Portugal, when the corps advanced from Lisbon to Salamanca,
and was assembled at Elvas under the command
of Captain Gordon, who, with his detachment, joined
the army of Sir Arthur Wellesley previous to its entering
Spain. Captain Gordon's party was attached to the
Second Battalion of Detachments, and had the honour
of sharing in the victory at <em>Talavera de la Reyna</em> on
the 28th of July, 1809<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>.</p>

<p>When the militia regiments were allowed, in 1809, to
volunteer into the line, the <span class="smcap">Queen's Royal</span> was very
successful in recruiting, and its establishment was increased
to 1000.</p>

<p>In July of the same year, the regiment formed part of
the expedition under the Earl of Chatham to the Scheldt;
was employed at the siege of Flushing, and, after the
surrender of that fortress, it remained in quarters at
Middleburgh, where it suffered severely from the Walcheren
fever. On the evacuation of the island in December,
the regiment embarked at Flushing, and returned
to its old quarters at Ipswich.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1810</div>

<p>During the year 1810, the regiment remained in England,
where it was joined in August by the detachment
which had been left in Portugal; and its numbers were
thus increased to 1126 rank and file.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1811</div>

<p>On the 25th of January, 1811, the <span class="smcap">Queen's Royal</span>
embarked at Portsmouth, with the Thirty-sixth, Second
Battalion of the Forty-third, Fifty-first, and Eighty-fifth
regiments, to reinforce the British army in Portugal.
The fleet, commanded by Sir Joseph Yorke, encountered
contrary gales, which so prolonged the voyage, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
convoy did not reach its destination until the 2nd of
March, when the regiment disembarked at Lisbon, and
went into barracks in the castle. It was afterwards
attached to the Sixth Division of the army, and engaged
with it in the pursuit of the French army under Marshal
Massena, who evacuated his position at Santarem, and
commenced his retreat into Spain a few days after the
arrival of the above re-inforcements. Many brilliant
exploits were performed by the adverse armies during
this retreat, and also in the subsequent operations on the
eastern frontier of Portugal. The <em>Sixth</em> Division was
subsequently employed in the south, under Sir Thomas
Graham, covering the siege of Badajoz, which was
menaced by the French Marshal, but surrendered to the
bold and superior tact of Lord Wellington in April, 1812.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1812</div>

<p>When Lord Wellington advanced into Spain in 1812,
and occupied <em>Salamanca</em>, the Sixth Division was quartered
in that city, and charged with the siege of the three
fortified convents, in which the enemy had left garrisons.
In the unsuccessful attempt to carry one of these forts,
(that called St. Vincente) by escalade, on the night of
the 23rd of June, in which Major-General Bowes fell,
the light company of the <span class="smcap">Queen's</span> lost Captain Sir
George Colquhoun, Lieutenant Mathews, one serjeant,
and six men killed, and was otherwise so reduced, that
it was found necessary next day to draft ten men from
each battalion company to complete it. After the reduction
of these forts, the <em>St. Caetano</em> and <em>La Mercea</em> by
storm, and <em>St. Vincente</em> by capitulation, the Sixth Division
joined the army in the advance to Toro, and took
part in the several movements which preceded and led
to the battle of Salamanca.</p>

<p>On this glorious day, the 22nd of July, 1812, the Sixth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Division was originally posted in reserve, to support the
Fourth and Fifth in the intended attack upon the enemy's
centre and the heights of Arapiles. After the crest of
the height had been carried by the Fourth Division, one
division of the French made a determined stand, and
after a sharp contest, obliged the British to give way.
Marshal Beresford, who was on the spot, directed
General Spry's brigade of the Fifth Division to change
its front, and attack the flank of the enemy; and Lord
Wellington ordered up the Sixth Division under Sir
Henry Clinton, to relieve the Fourth, and the battle was
soon restored to its former success. The French had
now but one hill left, on which they had concentrated
all their remaining forces. The Sixth Division was
ordered to advance in line upon the enemy's position,
which it did in a most gallant manner, under a heavy
fire of 21 pieces of cannon and of musketry; and after
a severe contest, the enemy fled through the woods
towards the Tormes, protected by the approaching darkness
of the night, by which many were enabled to escape:
the defeat of the French army was now completed.</p>

<p>The loss of the <span class="smcap">Queen's</span> on this day amounted to
nearly one-half its number present, the light company
being detached. One lieutenant (Denwoody) and 20
men were killed; its two majors, Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel
Kingsbury and Major Graham, (both of whom
afterwards received honorary medals from his Majesty,)
severely wounded; one captain (Scott) and three lieutenants
(Gordon, Williams, and Hudson), and 100 men
wounded. In fact, towards the close of the action, a
subaltern officer, Lieutenant Borlase, had the honour of
commanding the regiment. In honour of its gallant
services in this action his Majesty has been graciously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
pleased to permit that <em>Salamanca</em> should be added to
other distinctions on the colours of the regiment.</p>

<p>After the above defeat, Marshal Marmont withdrew
the army of Portugal in the direction of Burgos, and
Lord Wellington crossed the Douro and entered Madrid.
The allied army made a further advance to Burgos, the
siege of which was undertaken and pushed with vigour,
but was abandoned in October, in consequence of a junction
of the disposable French force in Spain, amounting
to between 80,000 and 90,000 men, and the determination
of the British commander to retire on the Douro, and
subsequently to Salamanca and to Ciudad Rodrigo. When
the army halted, the Queen's Regiment was quartered
at Fulgoza de Salvador; and being much reduced in
numbers, the head-quarters, with six skeleton companies,
were sent to England, and the remaining four companies
formed the right wing of the Second Provisional Battalion,
commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Bingham of the Fifty-third
regiment. The companies of the <span class="smcap">Queen's</span> were
about one hundred effective rank and file each, and the
battalion was posted to the Fourth Division, under
Major-General the Honourable Sir G. Lowry Cole.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1813</div>

<p>In the campaign of 1813, the four companies of the
<span class="smcap">Queen's</span> were frequently engaged, and showed the same
spirit of valour and discipline for which the regiment
had been distinguished on former occasions. In consideration
of the services rendered by this portion of the
regiment at the battle of <em>Vittoria</em> on the 21st of June
of this year, and of its uniform good conduct in the
series of actions which took place in the Pyrenees between
the 26th of July and the 2nd of August following, his
Majesty has graciously approved of the words <em>Vittoria</em>
and <em>Pyrenees</em>, being borne by the regiment, in addition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
to its other honourable badges of merit and royal
favour.</p>

<p>In reporting the above brilliant affairs, in which the
army of the allies, commanded by the Duke of Wellington,
was eminently successful in driving the French force
under Marshal Soult from their strong holds, his
Grace observes, 'In the course of this contest (28th July)
the Fourth Division, which has so frequently been
distinguished in this army, surpassed its former good
conduct.' In the action fought two days subsequently,
when Marshal Soult's army was posted in a
position so formidable, that the Duke of Wellington, in
his dispatches, characterises it as one of the strongest,
and most difficult of access, he had ever yet seen occupied
by troops, the steep hill, crowned with French soldiers,
was boldly ascended, and the front of the enemy's
main position was fearlessly attacked by a part of
Sir Lowry Cole's Division; on which occasion the
Battalion, comprising the Queen's and Fifty-third Regiments,
is mentioned as having been led by Colonel
Bingham.</p>

<p>In conjunction with this operation, the Third Division,
under Sir Thomas Picton, having advanced on the
enemy's left, the French fled in great confusion, leaving
4000 of their infantry unsupported in the valley, one
half of whom were obliged to surrender at discretion.
Thus were the attempts of the French Marshal to relieve
Pampeluna frustrated, and his army doomed to suffer
defeat and severe loss in defiance of extraordinary exertions,
which gave them sanguine expectation of success.
In these affairs several men of the <span class="smcap">Queen's</span> were killed,
and Lieutenant Hutton and a great number wounded.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of August, the Fourth Division advanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
to the Puerto de Echalar, and afterwards moved to
Lezaca to cover the head-quarters. At the latter place
the Duke of Wellington remained stationary with his
army in position to cover the siege of <em>St. Sebastian</em>, at
this time pushed with great vigour by a portion of the
allied army under Sir Thomas Graham.</p>

<p>No movement of consequence was made until the 31st
of August, when the French crossed the Bidassoa in
considerable force. With great fury they made repeated
attacks on the Spanish position on the heights of San
Marcial. The First and Fourth Divisions were, in consequence,
moved forward to protect the flanks of the
Spaniards, but the latter repulsed the enemy with such
spirit, that they sought protection under their cannon;
and giving up all hope of the relief of St. Sebastian, they
re-crossed the Bidassoa, and during the night retreated
from their position on the left bank of that river. In
this operation the Second Provisional Battalion was left
at the pass of the Crown Mountain, to keep up the communication
with the Seventh Division.</p>

<p>On the 31st of August also the fortress of St. Sebastian
was attacked and carried by assault. The British army
had the proud satisfaction of victoriously entering the
territory of France, and was led by its able commander
to a position in front of the Bidassoa, considered one of
the strongest in the Pyrenees, extending from Zugano
Mardie by La Rhona to the sea.</p>

<p>In the storming of Marshal Soult's intrenched position
on the river <em>Nivelle</em>, on the 10th of November, the attack
of the centre columns was led by the four companies of
the <span class="smcap">Queen's</span>, supported by their comrades of the Fifty-third.
The men carried bags of fern to fill up the ditch,
and small scaling-ladders to mount the rampart of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
redoubt which they were ordered to take. In this service
they were completely successful. The battalion
advanced with a British huzza, and the enemy abandoned
the redoubt and fled. A deep ravine, immediately in
the rear of the work, prevented the further advance of
the <span class="smcap">Queen's</span>, who from the crest of the hill had opened
a sharp fire upon the fugitives. For the gallant and
successful services on this occasion, his Majesty has
graciously sanctioned the addition of the word <em>Nivelle</em>
to its other badges of distinction.</p>

<p>Soon after this action the army went into quarters for
a short time, while preparations were making for crossing
the Adour, and forming the blockade of Bayonne. The
<span class="smcap">Queen's</span> was sent to St. Jean de Luz for new clothing,
and rejoined the division at St. Severe. The Fourth
Division proceeded towards Bourdeaux, to support the
Seventh under Lieutenant-General Lord Dalhousie,
and after the surrender of that city returned to the Plains
of Toulouse.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1814</div>

<p>In the night of the 8th of April, 1814, the Fourth
Division struck its tents, and proceeding by forced
marches crossed the Garonne over a pontoon bridge; on
the next day the army closed upon <em>Toulouse</em>. On the
10th the Division proceeded along the front of the
enemy's strongly fortified position, exposed to a galling
fire of grape, until it reached the right of their line, when
it advanced up the heights; while the rest of the troops
formed in two lines in its rear. A strong column of
French now issued from the works, and threatened the
flank and rear of the Fourth Division; but the Second
Provisional Battalion, being thrown back <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en potence</i>,
opened a heavy fire and charged the enemy, who thereupon
retreated to their trenches; the brigade then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
pushed up the hill, and carried the point to which its
efforts had been directed. The city of <em>Toulouse</em> was now
enclosed on all sides except that of the canal of Languedoc,
along which a road was left open by the Duke
of Wellington, in order to save the town from the destruction
which must have followed its being taken by
storm. Of this road the French availed themselves,
and, retreating during the night, encamped about three
leagues off. Both armies being now apprised of the
abdication of Napoleon, the battle of <em>Toulouse</em> closed at
once the campaign and the war. In addition to the
other marks of distinction granted to the regiment for
meritorious services, it has been authorised by his Majesty
to assume the word <em>Toulouse</em>.</p>

<p>In commemoration of the meritorious services performed
during the Peninsula war, his Majesty was also
graciously pleased to authorise the word <em>Peninsula</em>, to
be borne upon the colours and appointments of the
<span class="smcap">Queen's Royal</span>.</p>

<p>The division of the <span class="smcap">Queen's Royal</span> serving on the
continent embarked at Barsac in June, and landing at
Cork marched to Fermoy, where it stayed about a
month, after which it proceeded to Plymouth, and subsequently
joined the head-quarters at Chichester.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1815</div>

<p>During the whole of the year 1815 the regiment was
stationed at Gosport; and in January 1816 it was
moved to Chatham, and from thence, on the 11th of
April, to Portsmouth, where it embarked for the West
Indies on the 24th of April, 1816, having previously
received 300 general service men from the depôt in the
Isle of Wight. It landed at Barbadoes on the 5th of
June, where it was quartered in barracks at St. Anne's.</p>

<p>Some time before the <span class="smcap">Queen's</span> arrived in Barbadoes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
martial law had been proclaimed in consequence of an
insurrection among the negroes, which, however, was
soon quelled. The sickly season, which usually sets in
about the month of September, was this year one of the
most fatal remembered for a long period, and the <span class="smcap">Queen's
Royal</span> felt all its severity. In October the yellow fever
broke out and raged with unabated fury until Christmas,
during which short space it carried off 11 officers, upwards
of 200 men, and more than half the women and
children of the regiment. The officers who fell victims

Clutterbuck, M'Dougall, Grey, Norman, and

Pendergrast, and Ensigns Massie and Richmond,
to whose memory their surviving brother-officers
erected a handsome marble monument in the Cathedral
Church of Bridgetown.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1817</div>

<p>In 1817, the right wing of the regiment embarked for
St. Vincent, and the left for Grenada; the men continued
to suffer from dysentery, and other complaints which
followed the ravages of the fever, and many were carried
off. Amongst the number was Lieutenant Adams, who
died of fever in Grenada.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1819<br />1820</div>

<p>In April, 1819, the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'reigment embarked'">regiment embarked</ins> for Demerara
and Berbice, the head-quarters with seven companies
being stationed at the first, and the three other companies
at the latter place. The men were very healthy
at the time of their arrival, but the climate of these
colonies (originally settled by the Dutch), the soil of
which lies below the level of the sea, soon, and severely,
affected both officers and privates. They suffered first
under intermittent fever, but the yellow fever afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
made its appearance, and carried off great numbers.
The detachment stationed at Berbice, which remained
perfectly healthy until the month of November 1820,
was, in a few subsequent weeks, nearly annihilated by
that baneful malady, amongst whose victims were
Major Thistlethwaite, the commandant, and Lieutenant
Glasson.</p>

<p>About this time the regiment received a new pair of
colours, which were consecrated, in due form, on the
parade ground near Eve Leary barracks, on the 10th of
November, 1820, and presented by Mrs. Jordan, wife of
Lieutenant-Colonel John Jordan, then commanding the
regiment. After the ceremony a splendid entertainment
was given by the officers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1821</div>

<p>The regiment having completed five years' service on
the West Indian station, was relieved, in 1821, by the
Twenty-first Fusiliers, and ordered home; it embarked
on the 10th, sailed on the 13th of April, and landed at
Gosport on the 13th of June. From Gosport it proceeded
to Winchester, and after a short stay there, to
Brighton, where it was reviewed by the Duke of York,
when his Royal Highness was pleased to express his
approbation of the appearance of the corps. On the
24th of August, 1821, the regiment, still at Brighton,
was reduced to eight companies on the following establishment:&mdash;1
colonel, 1 lieutenant-colonel, 2 majors,
8 captains, 10 lieutenants, 6 ensigns, 5 staff, 29 serjeants,
24 corporals, 12 drummers, and 552 privates.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1822</div>

<p>In April, 1822, the regiment received a route to march
to Hull in Yorkshire, where it remained in garrison a
few weeks: in June it was ordered to proceed to Dublin,
and arrived there on the 13th of July following.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>General Coates<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>, after commanding the regiment
nearly twenty-eight years, died on the 22nd of July, 1822,
and was succeeded in the Colonelcy by Major-General Sir
Henry Torrens, K.C.B., Adjutant-General to the Forces.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1824</div>

<p>The regiment remained at Dublin until May, 1824,
when it embarked for England, and proceeded to Gosport,
and in the month of August following it was moved
to Chatham.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1825<br />1826<br />1827</div>

<p>In the early part of February, 1825, the regiment,
consisting of thirty-two serjeants, twenty drummers, and
seven hundred and forty rank and file, commanded by
Lieutenant-Colonel J. Williams<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>, marched from Chatham,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>and embarked at Gravesend for Bombay, where
it arrived in the beginning of June, 1825. An augmentation
of two companies, with a recruiting company, was
made to the regiment on its embarkation for India
service. This reinforcement sailed shortly after, and the
whole corps, after assembling at Bombay, marched to
Poonah, the capital of the Deccan, in which cantonment
it arrived early in 1826. From Poonah four companies
of the <span class="smcap">Queen's Royal</span> were detached in September,
1827, on an expedition against the Rajah of Koolapore,
in the Mahratta country, south of Bombay. The light
company of the <span class="smcap">Queen's</span>, with the light companies of the
20th and other regiments, were formed into a light
battalion, under Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Place<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>, of
the Queen's, and proceeded for the above destination.
The service terminated the same year by the surrender
of the territory and the capitulation of the Rajah.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">1828</div>

<p>Major-General Sir Henry Torrens, K.C.B.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> (Adjutant-General
of the Forces), died on the 22nd of August,
1828, and was succeeded, as Colonel of the <span class="smcap">Queen's
Royal</span>, by General the Right Honourable Sir William
Keppel, G.C.B., from the Sixty-seventh Regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1831</div>

<p>In the beginning of 1831, the regiment marched to
Bombay, to take a tour of duty at the Presidency, and
occupied its former cantonments at Calaba. The
monsoon of 1831 passed off without any of the destructive
effects which marked that of 1825, when the regiment
lost many valuable men. The casualties in the regiment,
from climate, were little beyond what might be expected
in European countries; and during its service in
India, the same result has attended the good order and
regularity maintained in the <span class="smcap">Queen's</span>. It is due to the
corps to observe, that drunkenness has so far been kept
within bounds as to be considered an unusual crime, and
to be unknown in a company for a month together. To
this happy cause may be attributed the healthy state of
the regiment, and the circumstance of the hospital
having at times been without a single soldier in it. If
greater proof of the efficiency of the regiment were
required, such would be perceived by reference to the
reports of the inspecting generals.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1834</div>

<p>In 1834 the <span class="smcap">Queen's</span> was relieved by the 40th Regiment,
and returned to its former cantonments in the
Deccan.</p>

<p>General the Right Honourable Sir William Keppel<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>G.C.B., died on the 11th of December, 1834, and the
Colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Queen's Royal</span> was by his Majesty
given to Lieutenant-General the Right Honourable Sir
James Kempt, G.C.B. and G.C.H., from the 40th Regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1837</div>

<p>The Queen's Royal Regiment has continued to be
employed in the Presidency of Bombay to the end of the
year 1837, the period of the termination of this Record.
It remains an efficient corps, and the laurels which it
acquired in every quarter of the globe are preserved untarnished

Tangier, the Island of Bombay, and a sum equal to 300,000<em>l.</em>
sterling. Tangier is a place of great antiquity, and was formerly
one of the most splendid cities in Africa. It is stated by Procopius
Cæsariensis to have been founded by the Phœnicians; it
was known by the name of <em>Tingis</em>, or <em>Tinja</em>, and was taken by
the Romans under Sertorius. It was afterwards captured by the
Vandals, and was retaken by the celebrated Belisarius, who
restored it to Justinian. On the invasion of the Saracens it was
surrendered to them by Count Julian. In the fifteenth century
it was the scene of several desperate engagements between the
Moors and Portuguese; and in 1437 Prince Ferdinand was defeated
before the city, and his army subjected to an ignominious capitulation.
In 1471 it was taken by Alfonso V., king of Portugal.
After the death of Sebastian, it fell into the hands of Spain; but
upon the restoration of the Braganza family to the throne of Portugal,
in 1640, it was once more annexed to that monarchy.</p></div>

The services of the Earl of Peterborough, in support of the royal
cause, during the civil wars, entitled him to the favour of King
Charles II. at the Restoration; and the Colonelcy of the Queen's
regiment of foot, and the governorship of Tangier, were deservedly
conferred upon a nobleman who, under the severest trials of his
fortitude and consistency, had shown himself a constant and zealous
supporter of monarchical government. He was employed in
several important situations of trust in the service of King James II.,
and on the 20th of June, 1685, he was appointed colonel of the 3rd
Regiment of Horse, (now the 2nd Dragoon Guards,) from which he
was removed at the Revolution in 1688. His lordship died on the
19th of June, 1697, and was succeeded in his titles, &amp;c. by his nephew,

to the notice of his sovereign by Louis XIV., was created, in

<p><a name="Footnote_33_33" id="Footnote_33_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_33_33"><span class="label">[33]</span></a> Lieutenant-Colonel Williams had been with the regiment in
the West Indies. It was probably in consequence of his previous
sojourn in an enervating climate that he felt, shortly after arriving
in India, symptoms of chronic disease, so alarming when encountered
in the heated regions of the tropics. A return to Europe
was the course recommended, but Colonel Williams said, that
having been honoured by his King with the command of an old distinguished
corps, which he had conducted to the shores of India,
he thought it was not for a soldier in the prime of life to abandon
his post on the first summons, and preferred making trial of an
elevated climate on the Neilgherry-hills, in hopes of rejoining his
friends and comrades, with whose fortunes he wished to identify
his own. The change of abode was found to prolong his life, but
did not remove the complaint; and when a reluctant consent was
given to depart for England, it was too late: the hand of death
was approaching him, and he died at Cannanore, on the Malabar
coast, whither he had been conveyed for embarkation.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_34_34" id="Footnote_34_34"></a><a href="#FNanchor_34_34"><span class="label">[34]</span></a> When Lieutenant-Colonel Place was ordered to Koolapore,
he was so far gone in constitution, that his medical advisers suggested
the propriety of relinquishing the attempt to proceed on
active service. "I go&mdash;if I die on the road," was the reply of this
respected officer. On this occasion, as above stated, he was
charged with the command of a light battalion, and although no
fighting took place, he gained the confidence and esteem of all
who came in contact with him. Whilst employed on this expedition,
he was appointed, by the Commander-in-Chief in India,
(Lord Combermere,) to take command of the 41st Regiment, which
was also at Koolapore. Like the former appeal, this was also
one of duty and honour; and private considerations were again
disregarded. Colonel Place had a perfect sense of his danger
which at this time was but too apparent to every observer. He
assumed the command of the 41st; and by his death, which followed
in a few weeks after, his profession was deprived of a brave
soldier, and his associates of a valuable friend. Colonel Place
had seen much hard service in command of the light company of
the 77th Regiment, whilst employed in the Peninsula war, and he
had been quartered in Jamaica as major of the same corps shortly
before his appointment as Lieutenant-Colonel to the <span class="smcap">Queen's</span>.</p></div>

fifty-six years in the army, having entered the service in the year
1778. He served in North America and the West Indies, and

<p class="right">Horse-Guards, 16th May, 1801.</p>

<p class="noindent">The recent events which have occurred in <span class="smcap">Egypt</span> have induced
His Majesty to lay his most gracious commands on His Royal
Highness the Commander-in-Chief, to convey to the troops
employed in that country His Majesty's highest approbation of
their conduct; and at the same time His Majesty has deemed
it expedient, that these his gracious sentiments should be communicated
to every part of His Army, not doubting that all
ranks will thereby be inspired with an honourable spirit of
emulation, and an eager desire of distinguishing themselves in
their country's service.</p>

<p>Under the blessing of Divine Providence, His Majesty
ascribes the successes that have attended the exertions of his
troops in Egypt, to that determined bravery which is inherent
in Britons; but his Majesty desires it may be most solemnly
and most forcibly impressed on the consideration of every part
of the army, that it has been a strict observance of <em>Order</em>,
<em>Discipline</em>, and <em>Military System</em>, which has given its full
energy to the native valour of the troops, and has enabled them
proudly to assert the superiority of the national military character,
in situations uncommonly arduous, and under circumstances
of peculiar difficulty.</p>

<p>The illustrious example of their Commander cannot fail to
have made an indelible impression on the gallant troops, at
whose head, crowned with victory and glory, he terminated his
honourable career; and His Majesty trusts that a due contemplation
of the talents and virtues, which he uniformly displayed
in the course of his valuable life, will for ever endear
the memory of Sir <span class="smcap">Ralph Abercrombie</span> to the British Army.</p>

<p>His Royal Highness the Commander-in-Chief having thus
obeyed His Majesty's commands, cannot forbear to avail himself
of this opportunity of recapitulating the leading features of
a series of operations so honourable to the British Arms.</p>

<p>The boldness of the approach to the coast of Aboukir, in
defiance of a powerful and well-directed artillery,&mdash;the orderly
formation upon the beach, under the heaviest fire of grape
and musketry,&mdash;the reception and repulse of the enemy's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
cavalry and infantry,&mdash;the subsequent charge of our troops,
which decided the victory, and established a footing on the
shores of Egypt, are circumstances of glory never surpassed
in the military annals of the world!</p>

<p>The advance of the army, on the 13th of March, towards
Alexandria, presents the spectacle of a movement of infantry
through an open country, who, being attacked upon their march,
<em>formed</em>, and <em>repulsed</em> the enemy; then advanced in line for
three miles, engaged along their whole front, until they drove
the enemy to seek his safety under the protection of his entrenched
position. Such had been the order and regularity of
the advance!</p>

<p>Upon the 21st of March, the united force of the French in
Egypt attacked the position of the British Army.</p>

<p>An attack, begun an hour before daylight, could derive no
advantage over the vigilance of an army ever ready to receive
it. The enemy's most vigorous and repeated efforts were
directed against the right and centre. Our infantry fought in
the plain, greatly inferior in the number of their artillery, and
unaided by cavalry.</p>

<p>They relied upon their discipline and their courage. The
desperate attacks of a veteran cavalry, joined to those of a
numerous infantry, which had vainly styled itself <em>Invincible</em>,
were everywhere repulsed: and a conflict the most severe
terminated in one of the most signal victories which ever
adorned the annals of the British nation!</p>

<p>In bringing forward these details, the Commander-in-Chief
does not call upon the Army merely <em>to admire</em> but <em>to emulate</em>
such conduct. Every soldier who feels for the honour of his
country, while he exults in events so splendid and important
in themselves, will henceforth have fresh motives for cherishing
and enforcing the practice of discipline, and by uniting, in
the greatest perfection, order and precision with activity and
courage, will seek to uphold, and transmit undiminished to
posterity, the <em>Glory</em> and <em>Honour</em> of the <em>British Arms</em>.</p>

<p>Nor is a less useful example to be derived from the conduct
of the distinguished Commander who fell in the field.</p>

<p>His steady observance of discipline,&mdash;his ever watchful attention
to the health and wants of his troops,&mdash;the persevering
and unconquerable spirit which marked his military career,&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
splendour of his actions in the field, and the heroism of his
death,&mdash;are worthy the imitation of all who desire, like him,
a life of honour and a death of glory.</p>

<div class="fs90">

<p class="right">
His Majesty's Ship Audacious,<br />
<span class="padr1">18th January, 1809.</span></p>


<p class="noindent">The irreparable loss that has been sustained by the fall of the
Commander of the Forces, <em>Lieutenant-General</em> <span class="smcap">Sir John
Moore</span>, and the severe wound which has removed <em>Lieutenant-General</em>
<span class="smcap">Sir David Baird</span> from his station, render it the duty
of <em>Lieutenant-General Hope</em> to congratulate the Army upon
the successful result of the action of the 16th instant.</p>

<p>On no occasion has the undaunted valour of British troops
ever been more manifest. At the termination of a severe and
harassing march, rendered necessary by the superiority which
the enemy had acquired, and which had materially impaired
the efficiency of the troops, many disadvantages were to be
encountered.</p>

<p>These have all been surmounted by the conduct of the troops
themselves; and the enemy has been taught, that whatever
advantages of position or of numbers he may employ, there is
inherent in the British officers and soldiers a bravery that
knows not how to yield,&mdash;that no circumstances can appal,&mdash;and
that will ensure victory when it is to be obtained by the
exertion of any human means.</p>

<p>The Lieutenant-General has the greatest satisfaction in distinguishing
such meritorious services as came within his observation,
or have been brought to his knowledge.</p>

<p>His acknowledgments are in a peculiar manner due to
<em>Lieutenant-General Lord William Bentinck</em>, and the brigade
under his command, consisting of the 4th, 42nd, and 50th
regiments, which sustained the weight of the attack.</p>

<p><em>Major-General Manningham</em>, with his brigade, consisting of
the Royals, the 26th and 81st regiments, and <em>Major-General
Warde</em>, with the brigade of Guards, will also be pleased to
accept his best thanks for their steady and gallant conduct
during the action.</p>

<p>To <em>Major-General Paget</em>, who, by a judicious movement of
the reserve, effectually contributed to check the progress of
the enemy on the right, and to the 1st battalion of the 52nd
and 95th regiments, which were thereby engaged, the greatest
praise is justly due.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>That part of <em>Major-General Leith's</em> brigade which was engaged,
consisting of the 59th regiment under the conduct of
the Major-General, also claims marked approbation.</p>

<p>The enemy not having rendered the attack on the left a
serious one, did not afford to the troops stationed in that quarter
an opportunity of displaying that gallantry which must
have made him repent the attempt.</p>

<p>The piquets and advanced posts, however, of the brigades
under the command of <em>Major-Generals Hill</em> and <em>Leith</em>, and
<em>Colonel Catlin Craufurd</em>, conducted themselves with determined
resolution, and were ably supported by the officers
commanding these brigades, and by the troops of which they
were composed.</p>

<p>It is peculiarly incumbent upon the Lieutenant-General to
notice the vigorous attack made by the 2nd battalion of the
14th regiment under <em>Lieutenant-Colonel Nicolls</em>, which drove
the enemy out of the village, of the left of which he had possessed
himself.</p>

<p>The exertions of <em>Lieutenant-Colonel Murray</em>, Quarter-Master
General, and of the other officers of the General Staff,
during the action, were unremitted, and deserve every degree
of approbation.</p>

<p>The illness of <em>Brigadier-General Clinton</em>, Adjutant-General,
unfortunately deprived the army of the benefit of his services.</p>

<p>The Lieutenant-General hopes the loss in point of numbers
is not so considerable as might have been expected: he
laments, however, the fall of the gallant soldiers and valuable
officers who have suffered.</p>

<p>The Lieutenant-General knows that it is impossible in
any language he can use to enhance the esteem, or diminish
the regret, that the Army feels with him for its late Commander.
His career has been unfortunately too limited for
his country, but has been sufficient for his own fame.
Beloved by the Army, honoured by his Sovereign, and respected
by his country, he has terminated a life devoted to her
service by a glorious death, leaving his name as a memorial, an
example, and an excitement to those who shall follow him in
the path of honour, and it is from his country alone that his
memory can receive the tribute which is its due.</p>

<p class="right fs90">Horse-Guards, 1st February, 1809.</p>

<p class="noindent">The benefits derived to an army from the example of a distinguished
commander do not terminate at his death: his virtues
live in the recollection of his associates, and his fame remains
the strongest incentive to great and glorious actions.</p>

<p>In this view, the Commander-in-Chief, amidst the deep and
universal regret which the death of <em>Lieutenant-General</em> <span class="smcap">Sir
John Moore</span> has occasioned, <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'recals to the'">recalls to the</ins> troops the military
career of that illustrious officer for their instruction and imitation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir John Moore</span> from his youth embraced the profession with
the feelings and sentiments of a soldier;&mdash;he felt that a perfect
knowledge and an exact performance of the humble but important
duties of a subaltern officer are the best foundations
for subsequent military fame; and his ardent mind, while it
looked forward to those brilliant achievements for which it
was formed, applied itself, with energy and exemplary assiduity,
to the duties of that station.</p>

<p>In the school of regimental duty he obtained that correct
knowledge of his profession so essential to the proper direction
of the gallant spirit of the soldier; and he was enabled to
establish a characteristic order and regularity of conduct, because
the troops found in their leader a striking example of
the discipline which he enforced on others.</p>

<p>Having risen to command, he signalised his name in the West
Indies, in Holland, and in Egypt. The unremitting attention
with which he devoted himself to the duties of every branch of
his profession obtained him the confidence of <em>Sir Ralph Abercrombie</em>,
and he became the companion in arms of that illustrious
officer, who fell at the head of his victorious troops in
an action which maintained our national superiority over the
arms of France.</p>

<p>Thus <span class="smcap">Sir John Moore</span> at an early period obtained, with
general approbation, that conspicuous station in which he
gloriously terminated his useful and honourable life.</p>

<p>In a military character obtained amidst the dangers of climate,
the privations incident to service, and the sufferings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
repeated wounds, it is difficult to select any one point as a
preferable subject for praise: it exhibits, however, one feature
so particularly characteristic of the man, and so important to
the best interests of the service, that the Commander-in-Chief
is pleased to mark it with his peculiar approbation&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">The life of Sir JOHN MOORE was spent among the<br />
Troops.</span><br />
</p>

<p>During the season of repose, his time was devoted to the
care and instruction of the officer and soldier; in war he
courted service in every quarter of the globe. Regardless of
personal considerations, he esteemed that to which his country
called him, <em>the post of honour</em>, and by his undaunted spirit and
unconquerable perseverance, he pointed the way to victory.</p>

<p>His country, the object of his latest solicitude, will rear a
monument to his lamented memory, and the Commander-in-Chief
feels he is paying the best tribute to his fame by thus
holding him forth as an <span class="smcap">Example</span> to the <span class="smcap">Army</span>.</p>

<p class="right">
Horse Guards, 18th August, 1809.</p>

<p class="noindent">The Commander-in-Chief has received the King's commands
to notify to the Army the splendid victory obtained by His
Troops in Spain, under the command of <em>Lieutenant-General
the Right Honourable</em> <span class="smcap">Sir Arthur Wellesley</span>, on the 27th
and 28th of last month, at the <em>Battle</em> of <span class="smcap">Talavera de la
Reyna</span>.</p>

<p>His Majesty is confident that His Army will learn with
becoming exultation that the enemy, after escaping by a precipitate
retreat from the well-concerted attack with which <span class="smcap">Sir
Arthur Wellesley</span>, in conjunction with the Spanish Army,
had threatened him on the 24th of July, concentrated his
force, by calling to his aid the corps under the French General
Sebastiani and the garrison of Madrid, and thus reinforced,
again approached the Allied Army on the 27th of July; and
on this occasion, owing to the local circumstances of its position,
and to the deliberate purpose of the enemy to direct his
whole efforts against the Troops of His Majesty, the British
Army sustained nearly the whole weight of this great contest,
and has acquired the glory of having vanquished a French
army double their numbers, not in a short and partial struggle,
but in a battle obstinately contested on two successive days,
(not wholly discontinued even throughout the intervening
night,) and fought under circumstances which brought both
armies into close and repeated combat.</p>

<p>The King, in contemplating so glorious a display of the
valour and prowess of His Troops, has been graciously pleased
to command that his Royal approbation of the conduct of the
Army serving under the command of <em>Lieutenant-General</em>
<span class="smcap">Sir Arthur Wellesley</span> shall be thus publicly declared in
General Orders.</p>

<p>The Commander-in-Chief has received the King's commands
to signify in the most marked and special manner the sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
His Majesty entertains of <em>Lieutenant-General</em> <span class="smcap">Sir Arthur
Wellesley's</span> personal services on this memorable occasion,
not less displayed in the result of the battle itself than in the
consummate ability, valour, and military resource with which
the many difficulties of this arduous and protracted contest
were met and provided for by his experience and judgment.</p>

<p>The conduct of <em>Lieutenant-General Sherbrooke</em>, second in
command, has entitled him to the King's marked approbation.
His Majesty has observed with satisfaction the manner in which
he led on the Troops to the charge with the bayonet&mdash;a species
of combat which, on all occasions, so well accords with the
dauntless character of British soldiers.</p>

<p>His Majesty has noticed with the same gracious approbation
the conduct of the several General and other Officers&mdash;all have
done their duty; most of them have had occasions of eminently
distinguishing themselves, the instances of which have
not escaped His Majesty's attention.</p>

<p>It is His Majesty's command that His Royal approbation
and thanks shall be given in the most distinct and most particular
manner to the Non-Commissioned Officers and Private
Men. In no instance have they displayed with greater lustre
their native valour and characteristic energy; nor have they on
any former occasion more decidedly proved their superiority
over the inveterate enemy of their country.</p>

<p>Brilliant, however, as is the victory obtained at Talavera, it
is not solely on that occasion that <em>Lieutenant-General</em> <span class="smcap">Sir
Arthur Wellesley</span> and the Troops under his command, are
entitled to His Majesty's applause. The important service
effected in an early part of the campaign by the same Army,
under the command of the same distinguished General, by the
rapid march on the Douro, the passage of that river, the total
discomfiture of the enemy, and his expulsion from the territory
of one of His Majesty's ancient and most faithful Allies, are
circumstances which have made a lasting impression on His
Majesty's mind; and have induced His Majesty to direct, that
the operations of this arduous and eventful campaign shall be
thus recorded, as furnishing splendid examples of military skill,
fortitude, perseverance, and of a spirit of enterprise calculated
to produce emulation in every part of His Army, and largely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>

British nation.</p>

under the orders of Lieutenant-General Sir John Moore.</em></p>

<p class="pfs80">ON REGIMENTAL COLOURS.</p>

<div class="fs90">

<p class="noindent">The English Regiments of Foot had formerly a Colour to every
Company<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>. They were afterwards formed into <em>Three Divisions</em>
on the same principle as the Continental Armies, viz., <em>Two wings
of Musketeers, and a Centre Division of Pikemen</em>. Each Division
had a Stand of Colours, that it might act separately. The Swedish
Infantry were formed in this manner, by <em>Gustavus Adolphus</em>,
and were copied by Marshals de Turenne and Montecuculi.</p>

<p>This mode of formation was, however, changed during the
reign of Queen Anne, when the general adoption of Bayonets
took place, and, the Division of Pikemen being discontinued, the
<em>Third Colour</em> became unnecessary, and was consequently laid
aside.</p>

<p>The Queen's Royal Regiment had originally a Colour to every
Company, and after the year 1688 it had Three Stand of Colours,
in common with other Regiments: it happened, however, that the
Third Colour was retained in possession by the Queen's Royal
until 1750, probably from the long absence of the Regiment on
Foreign Service, it having embarked in 1730 for Gibraltar, where
it remained until 1749.</p>

<p>A belief had thus been induced that the Queen's Royal Regiment
had been permitted, <span class="fs70">AS A DISTINCTION</span>, to carry Three
Colours, as appears by a Letter from General Robert Donkin, who
entered the Regiment as an Ensign in 1747, and served in it until
1759. He states,&mdash;"On our marching over Island Bridge into
Dublin duty in 1750, the Third Colour was, by order of General
Fowke (then Colonel of the Regiment), taken out of my hand,
furled, and never flew since. The men grumbled exceedingly.
I felt myself hurt at being deprived of an honour no other Corps
then enjoyed."</p>

<p>With a view of establishing Uniformity throughout the Army
in the Colours, Clothing, and Appointments of the several Regiments,&mdash;a
Warrant, dated 1st July, 1751, was issued by King
George II., for regulating the Clothing, Standards, Colours, &amp;c.,
of Regiments of Cavalry and Infantry. By this Warrant it is
directed that&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>"The King's or <span class="smcap">First</span> Colour of every Regiment is to be the
Great Union throughout;"&mdash;and that, "The <span class="smcap">Second</span> Colour is to
be the Colour of the Facing of the Regiment, with the Union in
the Upper Canton."</p>

<p>At this period the Facing of the Queen's Royal Regiment was
<em>Sea-Green</em>, which was the original Facing of the Corps.</p>

<p>It is further directed, in the same Warrant, under the head of
"Devices and Badges of the Royal Regiments, and of the six old
Corps," as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">Second Regiment</span>, or, <span class="smcap">The Queen's Royal Regiment</span>."</p>

<p>"In the Centre of each Colour, the <span class="smcap">Queen's Cypher</span> on a
red ground, within the Garter, and <span class="smcap">Crown</span> over it: in the Three
Corners of the <em>Second</em> Colour, the <span class="smcap">Lamb</span>, being the ancient badge
of the Regiment."</p>

<p>A subsequent Warrant was issued on the <em>19th December, 1768</em>,
by Command of His Majesty King George III., prescribing "<em>Regulations
for the Colours, Clothing, &amp;c., of the Marching Regiments
of Foot</em>." This Warrant contains the same directions as
that of 1751 regarding "the <em>First</em> and <em>Second</em> Colours of Regiments,"
and "the Devices and Badges of the Royal Regiments
and of the Six Old Corps." The Facing of the Queen's Royal
Regiment was, at this period, changed from Green to <em>Blue</em>.</p>

<p>Neither of the Royal Warrants above mentioned contains any
Authority for the Queen's Royal Regiment bearing a <em>Third</em>
Colour.</p>

<p>The foregoing Statement shows, therefore, that, although the
<em>Third</em> Colour so long remained in possession of the Queen's Royal
Regiment, after other Regiments had laid it aside, it had been erroneously
considered that this Regiment had a <em>peculiar privilege</em>
of carrying <em>Three</em> Stand of Colours.</p>

<p>To correct this error, and to maintain uniformity throughout
the Army, His Majesty has recently directed "that no Regiment
shall, under any circumstances whatever, display a Third Colour;"
and the following Letter, dated 14th August, 1835, has been addressed,
by His Majesty's Special Command, to Lieutenant-General
the Right Honourable Sir James Kempt, G.C.B., as Colonel
of the Second, or Queen's Royal Regiment, by the Adjutant-General
of the Forces, dated</p>

<p class="right"><em>Horse Guards, 14th August, 1835.</em></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,<br />

<span class="pad2">By</span> desire of the General Commanding in Chief, I have the
honour to make the following Communication to you, for your information
and guidance; viz.:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>The 5th Foot having, at Malta, preferred a Claim to the distinction
of bearing a Third Stand of Colours, Major-General Sir
Frederick Ponsonby referred the Case for Lord Hill's consideration,
and his Lordship immediately submitted it to the King.</p>

<p>His Majesty at once disallowed this claim, and, at the same
time, inquired whether a similar claim had been made and admitted
in the case of any other Regiment.</p>

<p>Lord Hill mentioned the case of the Queen's Royal, and fully
explained the grounds upon which the distinction of a Third Stand
of Colours had, so recently, been conferred upon that Corps; when
His Majesty was pleased to decide, that no Regiment in His Majesty's
Service should be permitted to display a Third Colour,
under any circumstances whatsoever,&mdash;and to command that His
Majesty's said decision should be notified to you.</p>

<p>The King, however, expressed to Lord Hill His Majesty's
earnest hope that you, and the Queen's Royal collectively, would
regard this decision, not as a mark of His Majesty's forgetfulness
of the uniformly high character of the Regiment, but solely as a
proof of His Majesty's determination to establish uniformity in
this (as in every other) respect throughout the Army.</p>

<p>His Majesty was graciously pleased to observe, that it was impossible
for him to render more manifest the high estimation in
which he held the character of the Queen's Royal, than by transferring
an Officer of your reputation to the Colonelcy of it, from
that of one of the most gallant and distinguished Regiments in the
Service; viz., the 40th.</p>

<p>The King was further pleased to observe, that if it were wished
upon your part, and upon the part of the Queen's Royal, that the
Third Colour should be retained and preserved, His Majesty would
not insist upon its being actually withdrawn; but, in making that
observation, His Majesty expressly ordered, that on no account
should the Third Colour ever be displayed in the Ranks of the
Regiment.</p>

<p>Lastly, His Majesty was pleased to Command, that this Letter
should be entered in the Regimental Record, as well as in the
Standing Orders of the Queen's Royal.</p>

to the Officer Commanding the Queen's Royal in India, for his information
and guidance, with Orders to enter the same in the
Regimental Record, as well as in the Standing Orders of the Corps,
in obedience to His Majesty's Commands; and I am persuaded,
that the Officers and Men of the Queen's Royal, although thereby
deprived of a distinction which the Regiment has for some time
enjoyed, will, nevertheless, feel as I do, highly gratified by the very
gracious terms in which His Majesty has been pleased to direct
his decision upon the subject to be communicated to me.</p>

privilege of carrying an additional Colour.</p>

<p>The following is an extract from D'Auvergne's History of the Campaign
in Flanders in 1693, relating to the Battle of Landen:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Tis certain that we have taken from them (the French) <em>Nineteen
Colours</em> and <em>Thirty-seven Standards</em>, which, considering the proportion
of Forces, is more than they gained from us, particularly as to the
<em>Number</em> of <em>Colours</em>; for besides that the French had double our number
of Foot, their Battalions never have but <em>Three</em> Colours at the most
in each;&mdash;our Brandenburg and Hanover Foot have as many <em>Colours</em>
as there are <em>Companies</em> in every Battalion, insomuch that some Battalions
have a dozen;&mdash;and, therefore, it is more for us in proportion to
have taken <em>Nineteen</em> Colours from them, than if they had taken <em>Fifty</em>
from us."</p>

<p class="pfs70">MEMOIR OF SIR HENRY TORRENS.</p>

<p class="noindent">The following Memoir of the services of Major-General Sir
Henry Torrens is inserted, not only with the view of recording his
merits as an officer, but of showing to the army and to the public
one of the many instances in which the talents of an active and
enterprising officer were duly noticed and rewarded by the King,
and by His late Royal Highness the Duke of York, as well as by
other illustrious commanders of the army:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Sir Henry Torrens was born at Londonderry in 1779, and
having been educated at the military academy in Dublin, he was
appointed to an Ensigncy in the Fifty-second Regiment on the 2nd
of November, 1793, at the age of fourteen years; he was promoted
to a Lieutenancy in the Ninety-second Regiment on the
14th of June, 1794; and on the 11th of December, 1795, was
removed to the Sixty-third Regiment, then under orders for the
West Indies. At the attack of Morne Fortuné in the island of
St. Lucie, on the 1st of May, 1796, while serving with the army
under Major-General Sir Ralph Abercrombie, he was severely
wounded in the right thigh: after taking a prominent part in storming
three French redoubts, he was employed for the space of seven
months at an outpost in the woods against the Charibs: on the
conquest of those people he was promoted to a company in the
Sixth West India Regiment on the 28th of March, 1797. In 1798
he returned to England, and was appointed <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Aid-de-camp'">Aide-de-camp</ins> to Lieutenant-General
Whitelocke, then acting as second in command
under Earl Moira at Portsmouth; in November of the same year
he went to Portugal as <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Aid-de-camp'">Aide-de-camp</ins> to General Cuyler, who
commanded a body of auxiliary troops, sent thither by the British
government, to repel the threatened invasion of that country by
the Spaniards. While on service at Lisbon, he was removed
to the Twentieth Regiment, on the 8th of August, 1799, and immediately
relinquished the advantages of his Staff situation in
order to join his Regiment, which was a part of the force then
destined for the liberation of the United Provinces from the yoke
of France. Throughout the short but arduous campaign in
Holland, the Twentieth Regiment distinguished itself on every
occasion, particularly at the battle of Alcmaar on the 2nd of October,
1799: on the retreat of the British and Russian troops
upon the two villages of Egmont, and after a most severe conflict
with the enemy from morning till night of the 6th of October,
Captain Torrens received a severe wound from a musket-ball,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
which, passing through the right thigh, entered the left, where it
lodged so deeply as to baffle all surgical efforts to extract it.</p>

<p>On the return of the troops from the Helder, in November, 1799,
Captain Torrens was promoted to a Majority in the Surrey Rangers,
which he joined and commanded in Nova Scotia. In 1801 he
came back to England, and exchanged, on the 4th of February,
1802, to the Eighty-sixth Regiment, then serving in Egypt, to
which country it had come from India with a division of troops,
under the command of Major-General Sir David Baird. Major
Torrens lost no time in embarking for the Mediterranean: on his
arrival at Alexandria, he found that the object of the expedition
had completely succeeded, although attended with the melancholy
loss of his revered commander and steady friend, Sir Ralph Abercrombie,
who had been mortally wounded at the battle of Alexandria.
As the expulsion of the French rendered the presence of
a large force no longer necessary in Egypt, the auxiliary troops
from India returned across the desert, and embarking at Cosseir,
proceeded to Bombay. Soon after the arrival of the troops from
Egypt, hostilities broke out between the English and the Mahrattas:
in this contest Major Torrens again evinced his natural
courage and talents, and obtained the approbation of the officers
under whom he served: his health giving way to the active exertions
he had made in the execution of his duty, and suffering under
the effects of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de soleil</i>, he was compelled to have recourse
to a change of climate, and accordingly obtained leave to return
to England. On arrival at St. Helena, he found his state of health
so far improved as to induce him to forego his return to England,
and to go back to his regiment. While at St. Helena, he formed
an attachment to the daughter of Governor Patton, and was
married. On his return to India, he served under General Lord
Lake, until the conquest of Scindiah, the most formidable of
the Mahratta Chiefs. On the 1st of January, 1805, he was promoted
to the brevet rank of Lieutenant-Colonel, and in the same
year he returned to Europe: after his arrival in England, he was
employed as Assistant Adjutant-General in the Kent District. He
exchanged from the Eighty-sixth to the Eighty-ninth Regiment on
the 19th of February, 1807, and in the same year he proceeded as
Military Secretary to Lieutenant-General Whitelocke, with the expedition
against the Spanish colonies on the Rio de la Plata, and
was present at the disastrous attack upon Buenos Ayres on the
5th of July, 1807.</p>

<p>After his return to England, he was re-appointed an Assistant
Adjutant-General on the Staff of Great Britain, and subsequently
to be Assistant Military Secretary to His Royal Highness the Duke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
of York, as Commander-in-Chief. In the month of July, 1808, he
embarked with the expedition for Portugal, under the orders of Lieutenant-General
Sir Arthur Wellesley, and was present at the battles
of <em>Roleia</em> on the 17th of August, and of <em>Vimiera</em> on the 21st of
August, 1808, for which he received a medal struck for the purpose
of commemorating those victories, and of distinguishing the officers
engaged in them: he received also from the Portuguese Regency
the Chivalric Order of the Tower and Sword. These victories led
to the Convention of Cintra, and to the consequent evacuation of
Portugal by the French army under Marshal Junot, Duke of
Abrantes.</p>

<p>Lieutenant-Colonel Torrens returned to England with Sir Arthur
Wellesley about the end of the year 1808, and resumed his former
situation as Assistant Military Secretary to His Royal Highness
the Duke of York; he was promoted to be his Military Secretary
on the 2d of October, 1809. He was appointed from the
Eighty-ninth Regiment to a company in the Third Foot Guards
on the 13th of June, 1811, and Aide-de-camp to the Prince Regent,
with the rank of Colonel, on the 20th of February, 1812. He
was promoted to the rank of Major-General on the 4th of June,
1814, and in the new arrangement and extension of the Military
Order of the Bath in 1815, he was enrolled in the honourable list
of Knights Commanders: he was appointed to the Colonelcy of the
Second Garrison Battalion on the 5th of April, 1815; removed to the
Royal African Colonial corps on the 27th of November, 1815,
removed to the Second West India Regiment on the 21st of September,
1818, and on the 26th of July, 1822, he was promoted to
the <span class="smcap">Second</span>, or <span class="smcap">Queen's Royal</span>; on the 25th of March, 1820,
he was appointed from the situation of Military Secretary to that
of <em>Adjutant-General to the Forces</em>.</p>

<p>During the period of his employment as Military Secretary, in
which the most active operations of the late war took place, the
labours of his office were excessive, and his health became affected;
yet his exertions were never lessened, and after his appointment as
Adjutant-General, he undertook, with considerable labour and
zeal, the revision of the '<em>Regulations for the Exercise and Field
Movements of the Infantry of the Army</em>,' and, with the authority
of His Majesty King George IV., engrafted in them the alterations
and improvements which had been introduced and practised
by different Commanders during the late war.</p>

<p>The death of Sir Henry Torrens took place suddenly, on the
22d of August, 1828, while on a visit to his friend Mr. Johnes
Knight, at Welwyn, Herts., where his remains were consigned

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
